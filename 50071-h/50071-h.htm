<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TO CAROL</p>

<p>Dear, you asked me to write for you the story of
my work and adventures in France, and through all
the agonising hours of incubation and parturition you
have given me your unfailing sympathy, encouragement
and help. You have even chastened me (it was a
devastating hour!) for my&mdash;and, I believe, for the
book's&mdash;good, and when we discovered that the original
form&mdash;that of intimate personal letters written directly
to you&mdash;did not suit the subject matter, you acquiesced
generously in a change, the need for which I, at least,
shall ever deplore.</p>
<p>
And now that the last words have been written and
Finis lies upon the page, I know how short it all falls
of my ideal and how unworthy it is of your high hope
of me. And yet I dare to offer it to you, knowing
that what is good in it is yours, deep delver that you
are for the gold that lies&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in every human
heart.</p>

<p>Twenty months in the war zone ought, one would
imagine, to have provided me with countless hair-breadth
escapes, thrills, and perhaps even shockers
with which to regale you, but the adventures are all
those of other people, an occasional flight to a cellar in
a raid being all we could claim of danger. And so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
instead of being a book about English women in France,
it is mainly a book about French women in their own
country, and therein lies its chief, if not its only claim
to merit.</p>

<p>Humanness was the quality which above all others
you asked for, and if it possesses that I shall know it
has not been written in vain.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">MAINLY INTRODUCTORY</p>


<p>Relief Work in the War Zone. It did sound
exciting. No wonder I volunteered, but, oh dear!
great was the plenitude of my ignorance. I vaguely
understood that we were to distribute clothes and
rabbits, kitchen utensils, guano and other delectable
necessaries to a stricken people, but not that we were
to wear a uniform and that the uniform would be made
"by post." If I had there might never have been a
chapter to write nor a tale to tell.</p>

<p>That uniform!&mdash;shall I ever forget it? Or the figure
I cut when I put it on? Of course, like any sensible
female woman, I wanted to have it made by my own
tailor and in my own way. Strict adherence to the
general scheme, of course, with reasonable modification
to suit the individual. But Authority said NO.
Only by one man and in one place could that uniform
be made. Frankly sceptical at first, I am now a devout
believer. For it was certainly unique; perhaps in
strict truth I ought to say that several specimens of
it were unique. There was one&mdash;but this is a modest
tale told by a modest woman. Stifle curiosity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
be content with knowing that the less cannot contain
the greater. And then let us go hence and ponder
upon the sweet reasonableness of man, or at least of
one man who, when asked to produce the uniform hats,
replied, "But what for, Madam?"</p>

<p>"Well, to try on, of course."</p>

<p>"Try on? Why ever should you want to do that?"</p>

<p>Perhaps you won't believe this? But it is true.</p>

<p>Oh, the agonies of those last days of preparation,
and the heartrending impossibility of getting any
really useful or practical information about an outfit!</p>

<p>"Wear pyjamas, a mess-tin, and a water-bottle.
And of course you must have a sleeping-bag and a
bath."</p>

<p>This was at least encouraging. Were we going to
sleep <i lang="fr">à la belle étoile</i>, a heap of stones our pillow, our
roof the sky? You can imagine how I thrilled. But
there was the bath. Even in France.... I relinquished
the stars with a sigh and realised that Authority
was talking learnedly about the uniform, talking swiftly,
confidently, assuredly, and as I listened conviction grew
that once arrayed in it every difficulty and danger
would melt away, and the French nation prostrate
itself before my blushing feet in one concentrated
desire to pay homage and assist. One danger certainly
melted away, but, alas! it took Romance with it.
As a moral life-belt that uniform has never been
equalled.</p>

<p>And then there was the kit-bag. Ye gods, I <span class="smcap">KNOW</span>
that villainous thing was possessed of the devil. From
the day I found it, lying a discouraged heap upon my
bedroom floor, to the day when it tucked itself on board
ship in direct defiance of my orders and invited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Germans to come and torpedo it&mdash;which they promptly
did&mdash;it never ceased to annoy. It lost its key in Paris,
and on arrival at Sermaize declined to allow itself to
be opened. It was dumped in my "bedroom" (of
which more later), the lock was forced, Sermaize
settled itself to slumber. I proceeded to unpack,
plunged in a hand and drew forth&mdash;a pair of blue serge
trousers.</p>

<p>Wild yells for help brought Sermaize to my door.
What the owner of the trousers thought when his
broken-locked bag was flung back upon him, history
does not relate. He had opened what he thought was
<span class="smcap">HIS</span> bag, so possibly he was beyond speech. He was
a shy young man and he had never been in France
before.</p>

<p>If the thing&mdash;the bag, I mean, not the shy young man&mdash;had
been pretty or artistic one might have forgiven
it all its sins. Iniquity should always be beautiful.
But that bag was plain, <i lang="fr">mais d'une laideur effroyable</i>.
Just for all the world like a monstrous obscene sausage,
green with putrefaction and decay. What I said when
I tried to pack is not fit for a young and modest ear.
I planted it on its hind legs, seized a pair of boots,
tried to immure them in its depths, slipped and fell
into it head foremost. It was then the devil chuckled.
I heard him. He had been waiting, you see&mdash;he
knew.</p>

<p>It is some consolation that a certain not-to-be-named
friend was not on the hotel steps as I stole forth that
torrid June morning. Every imp of the thousand that
possess her would have danced with glee. How she
would have laughed: for there I was, the not-to-be-tried-on-uniform-hat,
a grotesque little inverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
pudding-bowl of a thing, perched like a fungoid growth
on the top of my head, the uniform itself hanging blanket-like
about my shrinking form (it was heavy enough for
the arctic regions), a water-bottle which had refused
point-blank to go into the kit-bag hanging over one
shoulder, and a bulging brown knapsack jutting
blasphemously from my back. What a vision! Tartarin
of Tarascon climbing the Alps with an ironmonger's
shop on his back fades ignominiously in
comparison. But then I wasn't just climbing commonplace
tourist-haunted Alps. I was going "to the
Front." At least, so my family said when making
pointed and highly encouraging remarks about my will.
That the "Front" in question was twenty miles from
a trench was a mere detail. Why go to the War Zone
if you don't swagger? I swaggered. Not much,
you know&mdash;just the faintest æsthetic suspicion of a
swagger, and then.... Then Nemesis fell&mdash;fell as
I passed a mirror, and saw.... I crawled on all
fours into France.</p>

<p>I crawled on all fours into Paris. Think of it,
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>! No wonder French women murmured, "Mais,
Mademoiselle, vous êtes très devouée." I am a modest
woman (I have mentioned this before, but it bears
repetition), but whenever I thought of that uniform I
believed them.</p>

<p>If Paris had not been at war she would probably have
arrested me at the Douane, and I should have deserved
it. Fancy insulting her by wearing such clothes, and
on such a night&mdash;a clear, purple, perfect summer night,
when she lay like a fairy city caught in the silvery nets
of the moon. And yet there was a strange, ominous
hush over it all. The city lying quiet and, oh, so still!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
It seemed to be waiting, waiting, a cup from which the
wine had been poured upon the red floor of war.</p>

<p>Wandering along the deserted quays, wondering
what the morrow would bring.... What a night
that was, the sheer exquisite beauty of it! The
Conciergerie dark against the sky, the gleaming path of
the river, and then the Louvre and the Tuileries all
hushed to languorous, passionate beauty in the arms of
the moon.</p>

<p>Don't you love Paris, every stone of her? I do.
But I was not allowed to stay there. Inexorable Fate
sent me the next morning in a taxi and a state of
excusable excitement to the Gare de l'Est, where,
kit-bag, mess-tin, water-bottle and all, I was immured
in the Paris-Nancy express and borne away through a
morning of glittering sunshine to Vitry-le-François,
there to be deposited upon the platform and in the
arms of a grey-coated and becomingly-expectant
young man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">EN ROUTE&mdash;SERMAIZE-LES-BAINS</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Like Bartley Fallon of immortal memory, "if
there's any ill luck at all in the world, 'tis on meself
it falls." Needless to say, I was not allowed to remain
in the arms of that nice young man; and indeed, to give
him his due, he showed no overwhelming desire to keep
me there. The embodiment of all Quakerly propriety,
he conducted me with befitting ceremony to the station
just as the sun began to drop down the long hills of
the sky, and sent me forth once more, this time with
a ticket for Sermaize-les-Bains in my pocket. My
proverbial luck held good&mdash;that is to say, bad. The
train was an <span class="smcap">Omnibus</span>. Do you know what that
means? No? Then I shall tell you. It is the
philosopher of locomotion, the last thing in, the final
triumph of, thoughtful, leisurely progression. Its
phlegm is sheerly imperturbable, its serenity of that
large-souled order which cataclysms cannot ruffle nor
revolutions disturb. A destination? It shrugs its
shoulder. Yes, somewhere, across illimitable continents,
across incalculable æons of time. The world
is beautiful, haste the expression of a vulgar age. To
travel hopefully is to arrive. It hopes. Eventually,
if God is good, it arrives.</p>

<p>And so did we, after long consultative visits to small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
wayside stations, and after much meditative meandering
through sunset-coloured lands. Arrived&mdash;ah, can
you wonder at it?&mdash;with just a little catch in our
throats and a shamed mistiness of vision, for had we
not seen, there in that little clump of undergrowth outside
the wood, a lonely cross, fenced with a rustic paling,
an old red mouldering <i lang="fr">képi</i> hanging on the point?
And then in the field another ... and again another<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">... mute, pitiful, inspiring witnesses of the grim</span><br />
tragedy of war.</p>

<p>And then came Sermaize, once a thriving little town,
a thing of streets and <span class="smcap">HOMES</span>, of warm firelit rooms
where the great game of Life was played out day by
day, where the stakes were Love and Laughter, and
Success and Failure and Death, where men and women
met, it might be on such a night as this&mdash;a night to
dream in and to love, a night when the slow pulse of
the Eternal Sea beat quietly upon the ear&mdash;met to tell
the age-old story while the world itself stood still to
listen, and out of the silence enchantment grew, and
old standards and old values passed away and a new
Heaven and a new Earth were born.</p>

<p>Once a thing of streets and homes! Ah, there lies
the real tragedy of the ruined village. Bricks and
mortar? Yes. You may tell the tale to the last
ultimate sou if you will, count it all up, mark it all
down in francs and centimes, tell me that here in one
brief hour the Germans did so much damage, destroyed
so many thousand pounds worth of property, ground
such and such an ancient monument to useless powder,
but who can count the cost, or appraise the value of
the things which no money can buy, that only human
lives can pay for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>One ruined village is exactly like every other ruined
village you may say with absolute truth, and yet be
wrong. A freak of successful destruction here, a fantastic
failure there, may give a touch of individuality,
even a hint of the grotesque. That tall chimney, how
oddly it leans against the sky. That archway standing
when everything about it is rubble and dust. That
bit of twisted iron-work, writhing like an uncouth
monster, that stairway climbing ridiculously into
space. Yes, they are all alike, these villages, and all
heartrendingly different. For each has its hidden
story of broken lives to tell, of human hopes and human
ambitions dashed remorselessly to earth, of human
friendships severed, of human loves torn and bleeding,
trampled under the red heel of war. Lying there in
the moonlight, Sermaize possessed an awful dignity. In
life it may have been sordid and commonplace, in death,
wrapped in the silver shroud of the moon, it was sublime.</p>

<p>As we passed through the broken piles of masonry
and brick-and iron-work every inch of the road throbbed
with its history, the ruins became infused with life
and&mdash;was it phantasy? a trick of the night? of the
dream-compelling moon?&mdash;out of the dark shadows
came the phantoms of men and women and little
children, their eyes wide with fear and longing, their
empty hands outstretched....</p>

<p>Home! They cried the word aloud, and the night
was filled with their crying.</p>

<p>And so we passed. Looking back now, I think the
dominant emotion of the moment was one of rage,
of blind, impotent, ravening fury against the senseless
cruelty that could be guilty of such a thing. For the
destruction of Sermaize-les-Bains was not a grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
necessity of war. It was a sacrifice to the pride of the
All-Highest.</p>

<p>In a heat that was sheerly tropical the battle had
raged to and fro. The Grande Place had been torn
to atoms by the long-range German guns, then came
hand-to-hand fighting in the streets, and the Germans
in possession. The inhabitants, terrified, for the most
part fled to the woods. Some remained, but among
them unfortunately not the Mayor. He had gone
away early in the morning. He was, perhaps, a simple-minded
person. He cannot have realised how inestimable
a privilege it is to receive a German Commandant
in the "Town Hall" he has just blown to infinitesimal
fragments. It may even be&mdash;though it is difficult to
believe it&mdash;that, conscious of the privilege, he yet dared
to despise it. Whatever the reason the fact remains&mdash;he
was not there. What an insult to German pride,
what a blow to German prestige! No wonder the
Commandant strode into the street and in a voice
trembling with righteous indignation gave the order,
"Pillage and Fire."</p>

<p>Oh, it was a merry game that, and played to a
magnificent finish. The houses were stripped as human
ghouls stripped the dead upon Napoleonic battlefields;
glass, china, furniture, pictures, silver, heirlooms
cherished through many a generation, it was a glorious
harvest, and what was not worth the gleaning was
piled into heaps and burned.</p>

<p>There are certain pastilles, innocent-looking things
like a man's coat button, round and black, with a hole
in the middle. They say the German army came into
France with strings of them round their necks, for in
the German army every contingency is provided for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
every destructive device supplied even to the last
least ultimate detail. Its organisers take no risks.
They never throw the dice with Chance. Luck?
They don't believe in luck. They believe in efficiency
and careful scientific preparation, in clean-cut work,
with no tags or loose ends of humanity hanging from
it. The human equation is merely a cog upon the
machine, and yet it is the one that is going to destroy
them in the end.</p>

<p>So they brought their pastilles into France just as
they brought their expert packers to ensure the safe
transit into Germany of all perishable loot. And if
ever you see some of those pastilles framed at Selfridge's
and ask yourself if they could really be effective&mdash;they
are so small, so very harmless-looking&mdash;remember
Sermaize and the waste of charred rubbish lying
desolate under the moon. Some one&mdash;I think Maurice
Genevoix, in <i lang="fr">Sous Verdun</i>&mdash;tells how, in the early
days of war, French soldiers were sometimes horrified
to see a bullet-stricken German suddenly catch fire,
become a living torch, blazing, terrible. At first they
were quite unable to account for it. You see, they
didn't know about the pastilles then. Later, when
they did, they understood. I was told in Sermaize
that a German aeroplane, flying low over the roofs,
sprayed them with petrol that day. If true, it was
quite an unnecessary waste of valuable material.
The pastilles were more than equal to the occasion.
But so was the French hotel-keeper who, coming back
when the Germans had commenced their long march
home, and finding his house in desiccated fragments,
promptly put up a rough wooden shelter, and hung out
his sign-board, "Café des Ruines!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>No one should go to Sermaize without paying a visit
to M. le Curé. He stayed with his people till his home
was tumbling about his ears, and even then he hung on,
in the cellar. Driven out by fire, he collected such
fugitives as were at hand and helped them through
the woods to a place of safety. Of the events and
incidents of that flight, of the dramatic episodes of
the bombardment and subsequent fighting&mdash;there was
a story of a French officer, for instance, who came
tumbling into the cellar demanding food and drink
in the midst of all the hell, and who devoured both,
M. le Curé confessing that his own appetite at the
moment was not quite up to its usual form, howitzer
shells being a poor substitute for, shall we say, a gin-and-bitters?&mdash;it
is not for me to speak. He has told
the tale himself elsewhere, and if in the telling he has
been half as witty, as epigrammatic, as vivid and as
humorous as he was when he lectured in the Common-room
at Sermaize, then all I can say is, buy the book
even if you have to pawn your last pair of boots to
find the money for it.</p>

<p>A rare type, M. le Curé. An intellectual, once the
owner and lover (the terms are, unhappily, not always
synonymous) of a fine library, now in ashes, a man who
could be generous even to an ungenerous foe, and remind
an audience&mdash;one member, at least, of which was no
Pacifist&mdash;that according to the German code the Mayor
should have remained in the town, and that he, M. le
Curé, had been able to collect no evidence of cruelty to,
or outrage upon, an individual.</p>

<p>That lecture is one of the things that will live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
my memory. For the Curé was not possessed of a
library of some two thousand volumes for nothing,
and whatever his Bishop's opinion may be on the
subject, I take leave to believe that Anatole France,
De Maupassant, Verlaine and Baudelaire jostled many
a horrified divine upon the shelves. For his style was
what a sound knowledge of French literature had made
it. He could dare to be improper&mdash;oh, so deliciously,
subtly improper! A word, a tone, a gesture&mdash;a history.
And his audience? Well, I mustn't tell you about that,
and perhaps the sense of utter incongruity was born
entirely of my own imagination. But to hear him
describe how he spent the night in a crowded railway-station
waiting-room where many things that should
be decently hidden were revealed, and where he, a
respectable celibate divine, shared a pallet with dames
of varying ages and attractiveness ... and.... The
veil just drawn aside fell down again upon the scene,
and English propriety came to its own with a shudder.</p>

<p>Yes, if you are wise you will visit M. le Curé. And
ask him to tell you how he disguised himself as a drover,
and how, when in defiance of all authority he came back
to Sermaize, he himself swept and cleaned out the big
room which the Germans had used as a hospital, and
which they had befouled and filthied, leaving vessels
full of offal and indescribable loathlinesses, where
blood was thick on walls and floor; a room that stank,
putrid, abominable. It was German filth, and German
beastliness, and French women, their hearts still hot
within them, would not touch it.</p>

<p>And ask him to tell you how nearly he was killed by
a shell which fell on an outhouse in which he was taking
shelter, and how he was called up, and as a soldier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
France was told to lead a horse to some village whose
name I have forgotten, and how he, who hardly knew
one end of a horse from another, led it, and on arriving
at the village met an irate officer.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Your regiment?"</p>

<p>"I haven't one."</p>

<p>"And the horse?"</p>

<p>A shrug, what indeed of the horse?</p>

<p>Three days later he was wearing his cassock again.</p>

<p>Once, when escaping from Sermaize he was nearly
shot by some French soldiers. There were only a few
of them, and their nerves had been shattered. Nerves
do give way sometimes when an avalanche sweeps over
them, and the Germans came into France like a
thousand avalanches. And so these poor wretches,
separated from their regiment, fled. It was probably
the wisest thing they could do under the circumstances.
"Sauve qui peut." There are few cries more terrible
than that. But a village lay in the line of flight, and
in the village there was good red wine. It was a hot
day, France was lost, Paris capitulating, and man a
thirsty animal. A corporal rescued M. le Curé when
his back was against the wall and rifles, describing wild
circles, were threatening him; finally, the nerveless ones
went back to their regiment and fought gloriously for
France, and Paris did not capitulate after all.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>With a howl of bitter anguish Tante Joséphine collapsed
upon the ground, and the earth shook. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Tante Joséphine was fat, and her bones were buried
beyond all hope of recovery under great pendulous
masses of quivering, perspiring flesh. And she had
walked, <i lang="fr">mais, pensez donc!</i>&mdash;walked thousands of
accursed miles through the woods, she had tripped
over roots, she had been hoisted over banks, she had
crashed like an avalanche down trenches and drains.
She was no longer a woman, she was a bath&mdash;behold the
perspiration!&mdash;she was an ache, <i lang="fr">mon Dieu!</i> not one,
but five million villainous aches; she was a lurid fire
of profanity. For while she, Tante Joséphine, walked
and fell and "larded the green earth," Grandmère lay
in the <i lang="fr">brouette</i> and refused to be evicted. At first
Tante Joséphine tried to get in too. Surely the war
which had worked so many miracles would transform
her into a telescope, but the war was unkind, and Pierre,
<i lang="fr">pauvre petit gosse!</i> had been temporarily submerged
in a sea of agitated fat from which he had been rescued
with difficulty. And Grandmère was only eighty-two,
whereas she, Tante Joséphine, was sixty.</p>

<p>All day long her eyes had turned to the <i lang="fr">brouette</i>, and
to Grandmère lying back like a queen. No, she could
bear it no longer. If she did not ride she would die,
or be taken by the Germans, and her blood would be
on Grandmère's head, and shadowed by remorse would
be all that selfish woman's days. The wood resounded
with the bellowings, and the green earth trembled
because Tante Joséphine, as she sat on it, trembled with
wrath and fatigue and desolation and woe.</p>

<p>Grandmère stirred in the <i lang="fr">brouette</i>. At eighty-two
one is not so active as one was at twenty, but one isn't
old, <i lang="fr">ma foi</i>! Père Bronchot was old. He would be
ninety-four at Toussaint, but she&mdash;oh, she could still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
show that big soft thing of a Tante Joséphine what it
was to be a woman of France. She was always a
weakling, was Joséphine, fit only for pasturage. And
so behold the quivering mountain ludicrously piling
itself upon the <i lang="fr">brouette</i>, Pierre, a pensive look in his eye,
standing by the while. He staggered as he caught up
the handles. The chariot swayed ominously. The
mountain became a volcano spurting forth fire. The
chariot steadied, and then very slowly resumed its way.
Half a kilomètre, three-quarters, a whole. Grandmère
was strangely silent, for at eighty-two one is not so
young as one was at twenty, and kilomètres grow
strangely long as the years go by.</p>

<p>Tante Joséphine snored. Pierre ceased to push.</p>

<p>"Allons, Allons. Pierre, que veux-tu? Is it that
the Germans shall catch us and make of you a stew for
their supper?" Tante Joséphine had wakened up.</p>

<p>"I am tired."</p>

<p>"Ah, paresseux." The volcano became active
again.</p>

<p>Pierre looked at Grandmère. How old she was!
And why did she look so white as she trailed her feet
bravely through the wood?</p>

<p>"Grandmère is ill. She must ride!"</p>

<p>What Tante Joséphine said the woods have gathered
to their breast. Pierre became pensive, then he smiled.
"Eh, bien. En route."</p>

<p>The kilomètre becomes very long when one is eighty-two,
but Grandmère was a daughter of France. Her
head was high, her eye steadfast as she plodded on,
taking no notice of the way, never seeing the deep
drain that ran beside the path. But Pierre saw it. He
must have, because he saw everything. He was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
that way. And that is why Tante Joséphine has
never been able to understand why she dreamed she
was rolling down a precipice with a railway train
rolling on top of her, and wakened to find herself deep
in the soft mould at the bottom of the drain, the <i lang="fr">brouette</i>
reclining on&mdash;well, on the highest promontory of her
coast-line, while Pierre and Grandmère peered over
the top with the eyes of celestial explorers who look
down suddenly into hell.</p>

<p>So and in such wise was the manner of their going.
Of the return Tante Joséphine does not speak. For
a time they hid in the woods, other good Sermaizians
with them. How did they live? Ah, don't ask me
that! They existed, somehow, as birds and squirrels
exist, perhaps, and then one day they said they were
going home. I am not at all sure that the authorities
wanted to have them there. For only a handful of
houses remained, and though many a cellar was still
intact under the ruins, cellars, considered as human
habitation, may, without undue exaggeration, be said
to lack some of the advantages of modern civilisation.
How was Tante Joséphine, how were the stained and
battered scarecrows that accompanied her to provide
for themselves during the winter? Would broken
bricks make bread? Would fire-eaten iron-work make
a blanket? Authority might protest, Sermaizians did
not care. They crept into the cellars that numbed
them to the very marrow on cold days, living like
badgers and foxes in their dark, comfortless holes,
enduring bitter cold and terrible privation, lacking food
and clothes and fire and light, but telling themselves
that they were at home and sucking good comfort from
the telling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Needless to say, there weren't nearly enough cellars
to go round, and direful things might have happened
but for a lucky accident. Hidden in the woods about
a mile from the town was an old Hydropathic Establishment,
known as La Source, which had escaped the
general destruction. Into it, regardless of its dirt and
its bleak, excessive discomfort swarmed some three
hundred of the <i lang="fr">sinistrés</i>, there to huddle the long winter
away.</p>

<p>As an example of its special attractions, let me tell
you of one woman who lived with her two children in a
tiny room, the walls of which streamed with damp,
which had no fireplace, no heating possibilities of any
kind, and whose sole furniture consisted of a barrow
and one thin blanket.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the Relief worker an ideal
case. Beautiful misery, you know. It could hardly
be surpassed.</p>

<p>A Society&mdash;a very modest Society; it has repeatedly
warned me that it dislikes publicity, so I heroically
refrain from mentioning its name<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;swept down upon
the ruins early in 1915, and taking possession of one
of the buildings at La Source, made the theatre its
Common-room, the billiard-room its bedroom, and a
top-loft a general dumping-ground, whose contents
included a camp bed but no sheets, a tin basin and jug,
an apologetic towel and, let me think&mdash;I can't remember
a dressing-table or a mirror. It was a very modest
Society, you remember, and the sum of its vanity&mdash;&mdash;?
Well, it perpetrated the uniform. Let it rest in peace.</p>

<p>Wherefore and because of which things a grey-clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
apparition, moving through the moonlight like some
hideous spectre of woe, arrived that warm June night
at La Source, and was ushered into a room where
innumerable people were drinking cocoa, rushing about,
talking&mdash;ye gods, how they talked!&mdash;smoking.... I
was more frightened than I have ever been in my life.
I am not used to crowds, and to my fevered imagination
every unit was a battalion. Then because I was hotter
and thirstier than a grain of sand in a sun-scorched
desert, cocoa was thrust upon me&mdash;<em>cocoa</em>! I drank it,
loathing it, and wondered why everybody seemed to
be drinking out of the same mug.</p>

<p>Then a young man seized my kit-bag. "Come
along." My hair began to rise. I had been prepared
for a great deal, but this.... I looked at the young
man, he looked at me. The situation, at all events,
did not lack piquancy! It was indeed a Sentimental
Journey that I was making, and Sterne.... But the
inimitable episode was not to repeat itself. My only
room-mate was a bat.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">FIRST IMPRESSIONS</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Sermaize, however, was not to be the scene of my
future labours. The honour was reserved for Bar-le-Duc,
the captital city of the Meuse, the seat of a Prefecture,
and proud manufacturer of a very special jam,
"Confitures de Bar-le-Duc." The mouth waters at
the very thought of it, but desire develops a limp when
you have seen the initial processes of manufacture;
for these consist in the removal by means of a finely-cut
quill of every pip from every currant about to be
boiled in the sacrificial pan. As you go through the
streets in July you see white and crimson patches on
the ground. They look disgustingly like something
that has been chewed and spumed forth again. They
are the discarded currant pips, for only the skin and
pulp are made into jam.</p>

<p>This unpipping (have we any adequate translation
for <i lang="fr">épepiner</i>?), paid for at the rate of about four sous a
pound, is sometimes carried on under the cleanliest
of home conditions, but occasionally one sees a group
of women at work round a table that makes jam for
the moment the least appetising of comestibles. Nevertheless,
if the good God ever places a pot of Confiture
de Bar-le-Duc upon your table, eat it; eat it <i lang="fr">à la Russe</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
with a spoon&mdash;don't insult it with bread&mdash;and you
will become a god with nectar on your lips.</p>

<p>There were about four thousand refugees in Bar.
That is why I was there too. And before I had been
ten minutes in the town a hard-voiced woman said,
"Would you please carry those <i lang="fr">seaux hygiéniques</i>
(sanitary pails) upstairs?" So much for my anticipatory
thrills. If I ever go to heaven I shall be put in the
back garden.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">À la guerre, comme à la guerre.</i> I carried the pails&mdash;a
work of supererogation as it subsequently transpired,
for they all had to be brought down again promptly,
so heavily were they in demand.</p>

<p>For the sanitation of Bar-le-Duc has yet to be born.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
One can't call arrangements that date from the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries sanitation, one can only
call them self-advertisement. Until I went to Bar I
never knew that the air could be solid with smell.
One might as well walk up a sewer as up the Rue de
l'Horloge on a hot day. Every man, woman and
child in the town ought to have died of diphtheria,
typhoid, septic poisoning, of a dozen gruesome diseases
long ago. If smells could kill, Bar would be as depopulated
as the Dead Cities of the Zuyder Zee. But the
French seem to thrive on smells, though in all fairness
I must admit that once or twice a grumble reached me.
But that was when the cesspool under the window was
discharging its contents into the yard.</p>

<p>The hard-voiced woman was hygienically mad.
She imported a Sanitary Inspector, an ironic anomaly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
who used to blush apoplectically through meals because
she would discuss the undiscussable with him. "I
hope you are not squeamish? We don't mind these
things here," she said to me. "It is so stupid to be a
prude."</p>

<p>Frankly, I could have slain that woman. She
wasn't fit to live. The climax came on a broiling day
when we were all exhausted and not a little sick from
heat and smell. She pleasingly entertained us at
dinner with a graphic description of a tubercular hip
which she had been dressing. There was a manure
heap outside the window of the sick child's room.
It crawled with flies. So did the room. So did the
hip.</p>

<p>She went back to the native sphere she should never
have left a few days later, but in the meantime she had
obsessed us all with a firm belief in the value of the
<i lang="fr">seau hygiénique</i>. Every refugee family should have
one. Our first care must be to provide it. The
obsession drove us into strange difficulties, as, for
example, once in a neighbouring village where, trusting
to my companion to keep the kindly but inquisitive
Curé who accompanied us too deeply engaged in conversation
to hear what I was saying, I asked the mother
of a large family if she would like us to give her
one.</p>

<p>"Qu'est que c'est? What did you say?"</p>

<p>Gentle as my murmur had been, M. le Curé was
down on me like a shot. The woman who hesitates
is lost. Anything is better than embarrassment. I
repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Ce n'est pas nécessaire. Il y a un jardin," was his
electrifying reply, and we filed out after him, with new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
ideas on French social questions simmering in our
heads.</p>

<p>More embarrassing still, though, was a visit to a
dear old couple living high up in a small room in a
narrow fœtid street. Madame Legrand was a dear,
with a round chubby face and the brightest of blue
eyes, a complexion like a rosy apple and dimples like
a girl's. She wore a spotlessly white mob-cap with a
coquettish little frill round it, and she was just as clean
and as fresh and as sonsy as if she had stepped out of
her little cottage to go to Mass. Her husband was a
rather picturesque creature, with a crimson cummerbund
round his waist. He had been a <i lang="fr">garde-forêt</i>, and
together they had saved and scraped, living frugally
and decently, putting money by every year until at
last they were able to buy a cottage and an acre or
two of land. Then the war came and the Germans,
and the cottage was burnt, and the poor old things
fled to Bar-le-Duc, homeless and beggared, possessed
of nothing in all the world but just the clothes on their
backs.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">garde-forêt</i> was talking to my companion. I
broached the all-important subject to Madame.</p>

<p>"Vous avez un seau hygiénique?" (I admit it was
vilely put.)</p>

<p>"Mais oui, Mademoiselle. Voulez-vous ...?" Before
I could stop her she had flourished it out upon the floor.
It seems there are no limits to French hospitality,
but there are to what even a commonplace English
woman can face with stoical calm. Lest worse befall
we fled. Somehow our sanitary researches lacked
enthusiasm after that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>"Bar-le-Duc, an ancient and historical city of the
Meuse, is beautifully situated on the banks of the
Ornain."</p>

<p>That, of course, is how I should have commenced
Chapter III, and then, with Baedekered solemnity,
have described its streets, its canals, its railway-station&mdash;a
dull affair until a bomb blew its glass
roof to fragments; when it became quaintly skeletonic&mdash;its
woods and hills, its churches and its
monuments.</p>

<p>Only I never do anything quite as I ought to, and
my capacity for getting into mischief is unlimited. I
can't bear the level highways of Life, cut like a Route
Nationale straight from point to point, white, steam-rollered,
respectable, horrible. For me the by-ways
and the lanes, the hedges smelling of wild roses and
woodbine, or a-fire with berry and burning leaf, the
cross-cuts leading you know not whither, but delightfully
sure to surprise you in the end. What if the
surprise is sometimes in a bog, in the mire, or in
a thicket of furze? More often than not it is in
Fairyland.</p>

<p>And so grant me your indulgence if I wander
a little, loitering in the green meadows, plunging
through the dim woods of experience. Especially as
I am going to be good now and explain Bar and the
refugees.</p>

<p>As I told you, there were some four thousand of them,
from the Argonne, the Ardennes, Luxembourg, and
many a frontier village such as Longuyon or Longwy.
And Bar received them coldly. It dubbed them, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
distinction of person, "ces sales émigrés," forgetting
that the dirt and squalor of their appearance was due
to adversity and not to any fault of their own. Forgetting,
too, that it had very nearly been <i lang="fr">émigré</i> itself.
For the Germans came within five miles of it. From
the town shells could be seen bursting high up the
valley; the blaze of burning villages reddened the
evening sky. Trains poured out laden with terrified
inhabitants fearing the worst, all the hospitals were
evacuated, and down the roads from the battle, from
Mussey, from Vassincourt, from Laimont and Révigny
came the wounded, a long procession of maimed and
broken men. They lay in the streets, on door-steps,
in the station-yard, they fell, dying, by canal and river
bank. Kindly women, thrusting their own fear aside,
ministered to them, the cannon thundering at their
very door. And with the wounded came the refugees.
What a procession that must have been. Women have
told me of it. Told me how, after days&mdash;even weeks&mdash;of
semi-starvation, lying in the open at night, exposed
to rain and sun, often unable to get even a drink of
water (for to their eternal shame many a village locked
its wells, refusing to open them even for parched and
wailing children), they found themselves caught in
the backwash of the battle. To all the other horrors of
flight was added this. Men, it might be their own
sons, or husbands, or brothers, blood-stained remnants
of humanity plodding wearily, desperately down the
road, while in the fields and in the ditches lay mangled,
encarnadined things that the very sun itself must
have shuddered to look upon. Old feeble men and
women fell out and died by the way, a mother carried
her dead baby for three nights and three days, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was no one to bury it, and the God of Life robed
himself in the trappings of Death as he gathered
exhausted mother and new-born babe in his arms.</p>

<p>And so they came to Bar. In the big dormitories of
the Caserne Oudinot straw was laid on the floor, and
there they were lodged, some after a night's rest to set
wearily forth again, others to remain in the town, for
the tide had turned and the Germans were in retreat.</p>

<p>There must have been an unusually large number of
houses to let in Bar before the war; many, we know,
had been condemned by the authorities, and, truth to
tell, I don't wonder at it. "House to let" did not imply,
as you might suppose, that it was untenanted, especially
if the house was in the rue des Grangettes, or rue
Oudinot, rue de Véel, or rue de l'Horloge. The
tenants paid no rent. They had been in possession for
years, possibly centuries. They were as numerous as
the sands of the sea-shore, and they had all the <i lang="fr">élan</i>,
the <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>, the vivacity and the tactical genius
of the French nation. They welcomed the unhappy
refugees&mdash;I was going to say vociferously, remembering
the soldier who, billeted in a Kerry village, complained
that the fleas sat up and barked at him.</p>

<p>The rooms, though dirty, unsanitary and swarming
with the terror that hoppeth in the noonday (there
were other and even worse plagues as well), were a
shelter. The war would be over in three months, and
one would be going home again. In the meantime
one could endure the palliasse (a great sack filled
with straw and laid on the floor, and on which four, five,
seven or even more people slept at night), one could
cower under the single blanket provided by the town,
not undressing, of course; that would be to perish. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
could learn to share the narrowest of quarters with nine,
eleven, even fifteen other people; one could tighten
one's belt when hunger came&mdash;and it came very often
during those first hard months&mdash;but one could not
endure the hostile looks of the tradespeople, and the
<i lang="fr">sales émigrés</i> spit at one in the streets.</p>

<p>The refugees, however, had one good friend; monsieur
C., an ex-mayor of the town and a man whose
"heart was open as day to melting charity," made
their cause his own. And perhaps because of him,
perhaps out of its own good heart, the town, officially
considered, did its best for them. It gave them clean
straw for their palliasses; it saw that no room was
without a stove; it established a market for them when
it discovered that the shopkeepers, exploiting misery,
were scandalously overcharging for their goods; it
declined to take rent from mothers with young families;
and it appointed a doctor who gave medical attention
free.</p>

<p>All very good and helpful, but mere drops in the
bucket of refugee needs. You see the war had caught
them unawares, and at first, no doubt for wise military
reasons, the authorities discouraged flight. People who
might have packed up necessaries and escaped in good
order found themselves driven like cattle through the
country, the Germans at their heels, the smallest of
bundles clutched under their arms, and the gendarmes
shouting "Vîte, Vîte, Depêchez-vous, depêchez-vous,"
till reason itself trembled in the balance.</p>

<p>Some, too, had remembered the war of <i lang="fr">Soixante-Dix</i>,
when the Prussians, marching to victory, treated the
civilians kindly. "They passed through our village
laughing and singing songs," old women have told me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Some atrocities there were, even then; but, compared
with those of the present war, only the spasmodic
outbursts of boyhood in a rage.</p>

<p>Consequently, flight was often delayed till the last
moment, delayed till it was too late, and, caught by the
tide, some found themselves prisoners behind the lines.
Those who got away saved practically nothing. Sometimes
a few family papers, sometimes the <i lang="fr">bas de laine</i>,
the storehouse of their savings, sometimes a change of
linen, most often nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Mais rien, Mademoiselle. Je vous assure, rien du
tout, du tout, du tout. Pas ça," and with the familiar
gesture a forefinger nail would catch behind a front
tooth and then click sharply outwards. When talking
to an excited Meusienne, it is well to be wary. One
must not stand too near, for she is sure to thrust her
face close to your own, and when the finger flies out
it no longer answers to the helm. It may end its
unbridled career anywhere, and commit awful havoc
in the ending, for the nail of the Meusienne is not a nail,
it is a talon.</p>

<p>No wonder the poor souls needed help. No wonder
they besieged our door when the news went forth that
"Les Anglaises" had come to town and were distributing
clothes and utensils, chairs, <i lang="fr">garde-mangers</i> (small
safes in which to keep their food, the fly pest being
sheerly horrible), sheets, blankets&mdash;anything and
everything that destitute humanity needs and is grateful
for. Their faith in us, after a few months of work,
became profound. They believed we could evolve
anything, anywhere and at a moment's notice. If
stern necessity obliged us to refuse, they had a touching
way of saying, "Eh bien, ce sera pour une autre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fois"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;a politeness which extricated them gracefully
from a difficult position, but left us struggling in
the net of circumstance and unaccountably convinced
that when they called again "our purse, our person,
our extremest means would lie all unlocked to their
occasion."</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>But these little amenities of relief only thrust themselves
upon me by degrees. At first, during the torrid
summer weeks, everything was so new and so strange
there were no clean-cut outlines at all. Before one
impression had focused itself upon the mind another
was claiming place. My brain&mdash;if you could have
examined it&mdash;must have looked like a photographic
plate exposed some dozens of times by a careless
amateur. From the general mistiness and blur only
a few things stand out. The stifling heat, the awful
smells, the unending succession of weeping and
hysterical women, and last, but not least, <i lang="fr">les puces</i>.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear the story of the Irish farmer who
said he "did not grudge them their bite and their
sup, but what he could not stand was the continule
thramping"? Well, the thramping was maddening.
I believe I never paid a visit to a refugee in those
days without becoming the exercising ground for light
cavalry. People sitting quietly in our Common-room
working at case-papers would suddenly dash away, to
come back some minutes later in rage and exasperation.
The cavalry still manœuvred. A mere patrol of two
or three could be dealt with, but the poor wretch who
had a regiment nearly qualified for a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Every visit we paid renewed our afflictions, and the
houses, old and long untenanted, being so disgustingly
dirty, we endured mental agonies&mdash;in addition to
physical ones&mdash;when we thought of the filth from
which the plague had come. Oddly enough, we did
not suffer so much the next summer, and we were
mercifully spared the attentions of other less active
but even more horrible forms of entomological life.</p>

<p>You see, it was a rule&mdash;and as experience proved a
very wise rule&mdash;of our Society that no help should
be given unless the applicant had been visited and
full particulars of his, or her, condition ascertained.
Roughly speaking, we found out where he had come
from, his previous occupation and station in life, the
size of his farm if he had one and the amount of his
stock, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, rabbits, etc.;
we made notes on his housing conditions, tabulated
the members of his family, their ages and sex, their
present employment and the amount of wages earned.
All of which took time.</p>

<p>Armed with a notebook and pencil, we would sally
forth, to grope our way up pitch-dark staircases, knock
at innumerable doors, dash past the murky corner where
the cesspool lay&mdash;I know houses in which it is under
the stairs&mdash;and at last run the refugee to earth.</p>

<p>Then followed the usual routine. A chair&mdash;generally
broken or minus a back&mdash;or a stool dragged forth with
an apology for its poverty: "Quand on est émigrée,
vous savez, Madame&mdash;ou Mademoiselle, je ne sais
pas?" and then the torrent. A word sufficed to unloose
it. Only a fool would try to stem it.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, you do not know what I have
suffered."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>So Madame would settle herself to the tale, and that
was the moment when ... when ... when doubt
grew, then certainty, and "Half-a-league, half-a-league,
half-a-league onward" hammered an accompaniment
on the brain.</p>

<p>In the evening we sorted out our notes and made
up our case papers. These latter should yield rich
harvest to the future historian if they are preserved,
and if the good God has endowed him with a sense of
humour. He could make such delicious "copy" from
them. For the individuality of the worker stamped
itself upon the papers even more legibly than the
biography of the case. There are lots of gems scattered
through them, but the one I like best lies in the column
headed Medical Relief, and runs as follows&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i lang="fr">Aug. 26.</i> Madame Guiot has pneumonia. Condition
serious.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Aug. 31.</i> Madame quite comfortable.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Sept. 2.</i> Madame has died. (Nurse's initials
appended.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the papers you may read that such and such a
house is infested with vermin; that Mademoiselle Wurtz
is said, by the neighbours, to drink; that Madame
Dablainville is filthy and lives like a pig; that the life
of Madame Hache falls regrettably below accepted
standards of morality; and that Madame Bontemps,
who probably never owned three pocket-handkerchiefs
in her life, declares that she lost sixty pairs of handspun
linen sheets, four dozen chemises, and pillow and
bolster cases innumerable when the Germans burnt
her home.</p>

<p>You may also read how Mademoiselle Rose Perrotin
was nursing a sick father when the Boches took posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sion
of her village; how the Commandant ordered her
to leave, and how she, with tears streaming down her
large fat face, begged to be allowed to remain. Her
father was dying. It was impossible to leave him.
But German Commandants care little for filial feelings.
Mademoiselle Rose (a blossom withering on its stem)
had a figure like a monolith but a heart of gold. Even
though they shot her she would not go away. They
did not shoot her. They quietly placed her on the
outskirts of the village and bade her begone. Next
day she crept back again. She prayed, she wept, she
implored, she entreated. When a monolith weeps
even Emperors succumb. So did the Commandant.
A day, two days, passed, and then her father died.
They must have been very dreadful days, but worse
was to follow. No one would bury the dead Frenchman.
She had to leave him lying there&mdash;I gathered,
however, that a grave was subsequently dug for him
in unconsecrated ground&mdash;and walk, and walk, and
walk, mile after mile, kilométre after kilométre, longing
to weep, nay, to cascade tears; but, "Figurez-vous,
Mademoiselle. Ah, quelle misère. I had not got a
pocket-handkerchief!"</p>

<p>That a father should die, that is Fate, but that one
should not have a pocket-handkerchief!... She
wept afresh because she had not been able to weep then,
and I believe that I shall carry to my grave a vision of
stout, monolithic, utterly prosaic Mademoiselle Rose
toiling across half a Department of France weeping
because she had no pocket-handkerchief in which to
mourn for her honoured dead.</p>

<p>Or you may read of little André Moldinot, who was
alone in the fields when he saw the Germans coming,
and who ran away, drifting he doesn't know how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Bar-le-Duc, where he has remained in the care of kindly
people, hearing no news of his family, not knowing
whether they are alive or dead. Or of the old man,
whose name I have forgotten&mdash;was it Galzandat?&mdash;who
fought with the English in the Crimea, and who
lived with fourteen other people (women and children)
in a stifling hole in the rue Polval. Or of that awful
room in the street near the Canal where thirty people
ate and drank and slept and quarrelled a whole winter
through&mdash;a room unspeakable in its dirt and untidiness.
Old rags lay heaped on the floor, dirty crockery,
potato, carrot and turnip peelings littered the greasy
table, big palliasses strewed the corners, loathsome
bedclothes crawling on them. On strings stretched
from wall to wall clothes were drying (one inmate was
a washerwoman), an old witch-like creature with
matted, unkempt locks flitted about, and in the far
corner, on the day I went there, two priests were
offering ghostly counsel to a weeping woman.</p>

<p>Misery makes strange bedfellows, and the cyclone of
war flung together people who, in ordinary circumstances,
would have been far removed from one another's
orbit. At first the good and the bad, the clean and
the dirty, the thrifty and the drunken herded together,
too wretched to complain, too crushed and despondent
to hope for better things. But gradually temperament
asserted itself, and one by one, as opportunity arose
and their circumstances improved, the respectable
ceased to rub elbows with the dissolute, and they found
quarters of their own either through their own exertions
or through the help of their friends. Monsieur C. and
Madame B. (wise, witty, kindly Madame B.) were
especially energetic in this respect.</p>

<p>So we soon began to feel comfortably assured that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
tenants of Maison Blanpain and of one or two other
rookeries were the scum of the refugee pool, idle,
disreputable, swearing, undeserving vagabonds every
one. They took us in gloriously many a time, they
fooled us to the top of our sentimental bent&mdash;at first&mdash;but
we could not have done without them. For
though Virtue may bathe the world in still, white light,
it is Vice that splashes the dancing colours over it.</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p>Yes, I suppose we were taken in at times!</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Bar, beyond the Faubourg
Marbot, lies a wood called the Bois de Maestricht. The
way to it lies through a narrow winding valley of great
beauty, especially in the autumn when the fires of the
dying year are ablaze in wood and field. Just at the
end of the road where the woods crush down and engulf
it is a long strip of meadow, a nocturne in green and
purple when the autumn crocus is in flower, and in the
woods are violets and wild strawberries, and long trails
of lesser periwinkle, ivy crimson and white, and hellebore
and oxlips and all sorts of delicious things, with, from
just one point on one of the countless uphill paths, a
view of Bar, so exquisite, so ethereal it almost seems
like a glimpse of some far dream-silvered land.</p>

<p>And it was here, just on the edge of the wood, in a
small rough shack, that Madame Martin and her family
took up their abode. The shack consisted of one room,
not long and certainly not wide, a slice of which, rudely
partitioned off, did duty as a cow-house. Here lived
Madame Martin and her husband, her granddaughter
Alice, a small boy suffering from a malady which caused
severe abdominal distention, and one or two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
children. Le Père Battin, whose relationship was
obscure but presumably deeply-rooted in the family
soil, shared the cow-end with his beloved <i lang="fr">vache</i>, a noble
beast and, like himself, a refugee.</p>

<p>Le Père Battin always averred that he had adopted
the cow, it being obviously an orphan, homeless and a
beggar, but my own firm conviction is that he stole
it. It was a kindly cow and a generous, for it proceeded
speedily to enrich him with a calf which, unlike most
refugee babies, throve amazingly, and when I saw it
took up so much space in the narrow shed there was
hardly room enough for its mother. How Le Père
Battin squeezed himself in as well is a pure wonder.
But squeeze he did, and when delicately suggesting
that a gift of sheets from "Les Anglaises" would
completely assuage the miseries of his lot, he showed
me his bed. It was in the feeding-trough. One hurried
glance was enough. I no longer wondered why the
first visitor to the Martin abode, having unwisely
settled down for a chat, spent the rest of the day and
the greater part of the night in fruitless chase. I did
not settle down. "It was fear, O Little Hunter, it
was fear."</p>

<p>Nor did I give the sheets. The cow would have
eaten them.</p>

<p>I remarked that the day was hot, and repaired to the
garden (a wilderness of weeds and despairing flowers),
and there Madame entertained me.</p>

<p>She was an ideal "case." Just the person whose
photograph should be sent to kindly, generous souls at
home. She was small, active, rather witty, a good talker,
with darting brown eyes and a bewitching grin. She
wore a befrilled cap, and oh, she could flatter with her
tongue! A nice old soul in spite of the villainy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
which Père Battin subsequently charged her. Her
first visitor&mdash;she who unfortunately sat down&mdash;fell
a victim on the spot. So did we all. Heaven had
made Madame that way. It was inevitable. So all
the riches of our earth were poured forth for her, and
she devoured largely of our substance. Then the girl
Alice developed throat trouble and was ministered to
by our nurse, and she, I grieve to say, coming home one
day from the Bois, hinted dark things about Alice&mdash;things
which made our righteous judgment to stand on
end. We continued to pet Madame Martin; we did
everything we could for her except eat her jam.
Having seen the shack, and le Père Battin and that one
overcrowded room where flies in dense black swarms
settled on everything, where dogs scratched and where
age-old dirt gathered more dirt to its arms with the
dawning of every day, that jam pot contained so many
possibilities, we felt that to eat its contents would be
sheer murder.</p>

<p>And so the autumn wore away and winter came, and
then one day as I was going through the valley to visit
some woodcutters in the Bois, I met le Père Battin
driving home his cow. And he stopped me. Once
when speaking of the Emperor of Austria he had said,
"Il est en train de mourir? Bon. On a eu bien assez
de ces lapins-là." (He is dying? Good. We have
had enough of such rabbits.)</p>

<p>A man who can discuss an Emperor in such terms
is not lightly to be passed by, but I stood as far from
him as possible. I did not till then believe that
anybody could be as dirty as Father Battin and live.</p>

<p>But he thrust himself close, looking fearfully about
him, sinking his voice to a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Did I know the truth about the Martins? That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Alice had gone to Révigny? There were soldiers
there." He nodded sapiently. "But Alice was la
vraie Comtesse de&mdash;&mdash;" He mentioned a hyphenated
name. "Yes. It was true. She was married. A
young man, a fool. Mon Dieu, but a fool. She might
live in a shack in the Bois and her grandmother might
be an old peasant woman, but she was a Comtesse,
wife of the Comte de&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>I took leave to suppose that Père Battin was mad.</p>

<p>But he was circumstantial. "Yes. Her husband
had left her. An affair of a few weeks. Every gendarme
in the town knew. And Madame knew. Knew
and made money out of it. Many a good franc she
had put in her pocket. But the gendarmes were watching,
and one day the old woman and Alice would...."
Again he murmured unprintable things.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you are ridiculous." Alice Martin a
Comtesse! No wonder I laughed. But he insisted.
He kept on repeating it.</p>

<p>"La vraie Comtesse de&mdash;&mdash;" But now she
was....</p>

<p>The dark sayings of the district nurse came back to
my mind and I wondered. But Père Battin was
offensive to ear and eye. I wished him <i lang="fr">bonjour</i>,
watching him trailing down the path, his <i lang="fr">vache</i> ruminatingly
leading, and then went on my way to the wood.</p>

<p>An hour later Madame Martin came running down the
hill to greet me. She had seen me go by and waited.
In her hand was a bunch of flowers, the best, least
discouraged from her untended garden.</p>

<p>"For Mademoiselle," she said, and as she held them
out her smile scattered gold dust upon my heart.</p>

<p>Now do you think le Père Battin's story was true?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">À TRAVERS BAR-LE-DUC</p>


<p>Whether it was or not, it has come rather too soon
in my narrative, I am afraid. It has carried me far
away from the days when the quaint individual charm
of Bar-le-Duc began to assert itself, little by little,
slowly, but with such cumulative effect that in the
end we grew to love it.</p>

<p>Our work took us into every lane and street, but it
was the Ville-Haute that I loved best. I wish I could
describe it to you as it lies on the hill; wish I could
take you up the steep narrow lane that leads to the
rue St Jean, and then into the rue de l'Armurier
which bends like a giant S and is so narrow you fancy
you could touch the houses on either side by stretching
out your arms. Small boys tobogganed down it in
the great frost last year. It was rare sport for the
small boys, but disastrous to sober-minded propriety
which occasionally found that it, too, was tobogganing&mdash;but
not on a tray&mdash;and with an absence of grace
and premeditation that were devastating in their
results.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Ville-Haute was a death-trap during
those weeks. There were slides everywhere. The
Place St Pierre was scarred with them, the wonderful
Place which, pear-shaped, wide at the top, narrowing
to its lower end, lies encircled in the arms of the rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
des Dues de Bar and of the rue des Grangettes. And
at the top, commandingly in the centre stands the
church of St Pierre&mdash;once St Maze&mdash;where the famous
statue, the "Squelette," is now buried so many
fathoms deep in sandbags nothing can be seen of it
at all. It is said that Mr. Edmund Gosse once came
to spend a night in Bar and was so bewitched by its
beauty he remained for several weeks, writing a
charming little romance about it in which the "Squelette"
plays a prominent part. And, indeed, the only
way to know Bar is to live in it. It would be quite
easy to tell you of the Tour de l'Horloge standing on
guard on the hill; of the fifteenth-and sixteenth-century
houses; of the Pont Nôtre Dame; of the Canal des
Usines which always reminded me of Bruges; of the
river winding through the Lower Town, tall poplars
standing sentinel along the banks; of the great canal
that cuts a fine almost parallel to that of the river
and which, if only you followed it far enough, would
bring you at last to the Rhine; of winding Polval that
is so exquisite in snow and on a moonlit night, with
its houses piled one above the other like an old Italian
town; or of the fine arched gate that leads to the
Place du Château and that led there when the stately
Dukes of Bar held court in the street that bears their
name, and led there, too, when Charles Stuart lived
in the High Town and dreamed perhaps of a kingdom
beyond the seas. Of all these things and of the
beautiful cloistered sixteenth-century College in the
rue Gilles de Trêves one might speak, exhausting the
mines of their adjectives and similes, but would you
be any closer to the soul of the town? I doubt it,
and so I refrain from description. For Bar depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
for its beauty and its distinctive charm on something
more than mere outline. Colour, atmosphere, some
ghostly raiment of the past still clinging to its limbs,
and over all the views over the valley&mdash;yes, the soul
is elusive and intangible; you will find it most surely
under the white rays of the moon.</p>

<p>The views are simply intoxicating, but if you want to
see one of the finest you must make the acquaintance of
a certain Madame&mdash;Madame, shall we say, Schneider?
Any name will do if only it is Teutonic enough. She
loomed upon our horizon as the purveyor of corduroy
trousers. Oh, not for a profit. She, <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>,
was a philanthropist disposing of the salvage of a
large shop, the owner of which was a refugee. The
trousers being much needed at the moment we bought
them, but many months afterwards she came with
serge garments that were not even remotely connected
with a refugee, so I am prone to believe that
she was not quite so disinterested as she would have
had us believe.</p>

<p>To visit her you must climb to the Ville-Haute, and
there in a house panelled throughout (such woodwork&mdash;old,
old, old&mdash;my very eyes water at the thought of
it), you will find a long low room with a wide window
springing like a balcony over the gulf that lies under
the rue Chavé. And from the window you can look
far over the town which lies beneath you, over the
silver path of river and canal to the Côte Ste Catherine,
the steep hill, once a vineyard, that rises on the other
side; you can see the aviation ground, and you can
follow the white ribbon of road that runs past Naives
to St Mihiel. And you can look up and down the
valley for miles&mdash;to Fains, to Mussey and beyond, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
one hand to Longeville, and Trouville on the other.
And Marbot lies all unlocked under your eyes, and
Maestricht, and the beautiful hill over which, if you are
wise, you will one day walk to Resson.</p>

<p>From Place Tribel, from innumerable coigns of
vantage, the view is equally beautiful, though not, I
think, quite so extensive. Which, perhaps coupled
with her aggressively Teutonic name, accounted for
the suspicious looks cast last winter upon Madame
Schneider. A spy! Oh, yes, a devout Catholic
always at the Mass, but a spy. Did she not leave
Bar on the very morning of the big air raid, returning
that night? And didn't every one know that she
signalled by means of lights movements of troops and
of aeroplanes to other spies hidden on the hill beyond
Naives? The preposterous story gained ground.
Then one day we thrilled to hear that Madame Schneider
had been arrested. She disappeared for a while&mdash;we
never knew whether anything had been proved
against her&mdash;and then when we had forgotten all
about her I met her in the Place St Pierre. She was
coming out of the church, but she bowed her head and
passed by.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all this, you won't care to visit her?
But then you will go down to your grave sorrowing,
because you will never see those Boiseries, nor that
view.</p>

<p>Other things beside the beauty of the town began to
creep into prominence too, of course, and among them
the supreme patience and courage of our refugee
women. In circumstances that might have crushed
the strongest they fought gamely and with few exceptions
conquered. I take my hat off to the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
nation. We know how its men can fight, some day
I hope the world will know how its women can endure.
Remember that they were given no separation allowances
until January 1915, and the allowance when it
did come was a pittance. One franc twenty-five
centimes per day for each adult, fifty centimes a day
for each child up to the age of sixteen; or, roughly
speaking, 1<i lang="fr">s.</i> a day and 4&frac12;<i lang="fr">d.</i> per day. What would
our English women say to that? It barely sufficed
for food. Indeed, as time went on and prices rose
I dare to say it did not even suffice for food. The
refugee woman, possessed of not one stick of furniture&mdash;except
in the case of farmers who were able to bring
away some household goods in their carts&mdash;of not one
cup or plate or jug or spoon, without needles, thread,
or scissors, without even a comb, and all too often
without even a change of linen, had to manage as best
she could. That she did manage is the triumph of
French thrift and cleverness in turning everything
to account. We heard of them making <i lang="fr">duvets</i> by
filling sacks with dried leaves; one woman actually
collected enough thistle-down for the purpose. They
clung desperately to their standards, they would
trudge miles to the woods in order to get a faggot for
their fire, they took any and every kind of work
that offered, they refused to become submerged.</p>

<p>And gradually they began to assume individuality.
Families and family histories began to limn themselves
on the brain as did the life of the streets, things
as well as people.</p>

<p>Some of these histories I must tell you later on;
to-night, for some odd reason, little Mademoiselle
Froment is in my mind. She was not a refugee, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I owe her a debt of eternal gratitude, for when I fled
to her immediately on arrival she condoled with me
in my sartorial afflictions and promptly made me
garments in which without shame I could worship
the Goddess of Reason. Later on the uniform was
chopped up and re-made, becoming wearable, but
never smart. Even French magic could not accomplish
that.</p>

<p>Poor little Mademoiselle Froment, so patient with
all my ignorances, my complete inability to understand
the value of what she called "le mouvement" of my
gown, and my hurried dips into Bellows as she volubly
discursed of the fashions. Last summer when she was
making me some more clothes she was sad indeed.
Her only and adored brother, who had passed scatheless
through the inferno at Verdun, was killed on the
Somme.</p>

<p>"My hurried dips into Bellows." Does that mean
anything, or does it sound like transcendental nonsense?
Bellows, by the way, is not a thing to blow the fire
with, it is a dictionary&mdash;a pocket dictionary worth
its weight in good red gold. And to my copy hangs
a tale. Can you endure a little autobiography?</p>

<p>During my week-end at Sermaize I heard more
French than I had heard, I suppose, in all my life before,
or at least I heard new words in such bewildering
profusion that I really believe Bellows saved my life.
I carried him about, I referred to him at frequent
intervals. I flatter myself that with his aid I made
myself intelligible even when discussing the technique
of agriculture and other such abstruse subjects.</p>

<p>But it is Bellows' deplorable misfortune to look
rather like a Prayer Book, or a Bible. And so it befell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that when I had been some weeks at Bar a Sermaizian
Relief Worker made anxious inquiries as to my character.
"She seems such an odd sort of person because,
though she reads her Bible ostentatiously in public,
she smokes, and we once heard her say...." After
all, does it really matter what they heard me say?</p>

<p>After which confession of my sins I must tell you
about the Temple, the shrine of French Protestantism
in Bar. There we stood up to pray, and we sat down
to sing the most lugubrious hymns it has ever been
my lot to listen to. The church is large, and the
congregation is small. On the hottest day in summer
it struck chill, in winter it was a refrigerator. The
pastor, being <i lang="fr">mobilisé</i>, his place was generally taken
by an earnest and I am sure devout being, who having
congratulated the present generation, the first time
I went there, upon having been chosen to defend the
cause of justice and of truth, proceeded to dwell with
the most heartrending emphasis upon every detail of
the suffering and sorrow the war&mdash;the defence upon
which he congratulated us!&mdash;has caused. He spared
us nothing. Not even the shell-riven soldier with
white face upturned questioningly to the stars. Not
even the fear-racked mother or wife to whom one day
the dreaded message comes. Then when he had
reduced every one to abysmal depression and many
to silent pitiful tears, he cried, "Soyez des optimistes,"
and seemed to think that the crying would suffice.
Why? Ah, don't ask me that! Perhaps the war is
too big a thing for the preachers to handle. The
platitudes of years have been drowned by the mutter
of the guns and the long sad wail of broken, shattered
humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the Temple depressed me. Writing of it even
now sends me into the profundities. It was all so
cheerless, so dreary. In spite of the drop of Huguenot
blood in my veins, the Temple and I are in nothing
akin.</p>

<p>So let us away&mdash;away from the cold shadows and
the cheerless creed, from the joyless God and the altar
where Beauty lies dead, out into the boulevard where
the trees are in leaf and the sun is shining, and where
you may see a regiment go by in its horizon blue, or a
battery of artillery with its camouflaged guns. Smoke
is pouring from the chimney of the regimental kitchen,
how jolly it looks curling up against the sky! and
sitting by the driver of the third ammunition cart is
a fox terrier who knows so much about war he will
be a field-marshal when he lives again. Or we may see
a team of woodcutters with the trunks of mighty
trees slung on axles with great chains and drawn
tandemwise by two or three horses, and hear the
lame newsvendor at the corner near l'église St Jean
calling his "Le Gé, le Pay-Gé, et le Petit-Parisien."
Pronounce the g soft in Gé, of course, for it stands for
<i lang="fr">Le Journal</i>, and Pay-Gé for <i lang="fr">Le Petit Journal</i>, all of
which, together with the <i lang="fr">Continental Daily Mail</i>,
can be bought in Bar each day shortly after one
o'clock unless the trains happen to be running late.
During the Verdun rush they sometimes did not
arrive at all.</p>

<p>A more musical cry, however, is that of the rabbit-skin
man, "Peau de li-è-vre, Peau de li-è-vre," with
a delicious lilting cadence on li-è-vre. I never discovered
what he gave in exchange for the skins, but
it was certainly not money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Or the Tambour may take up his position at the
corner of the street, the Tambour who swells with
pride and civic dignity. A sharp tap-tap on his drum,
the crowd collects and then in a hoarse roar he shouts
his decree. It may concern mad dogs, or the water
supply, or the day on which the <i lang="fr">allocation</i> will be
given to the <i lang="fr">emigrés</i>, or it may be instructions how to
behave during an air raid. Whatever it is, it is extremely
difficult to make sense of it, as a motor-car
and a huge military lorry are sure to crash past as he
roars. But nothing disconcerts him. He shouts to
his appointed end, and then with a swaggering roll on
his drum marches off to the next street-crossing.</p>

<p>If luck is with us as we prowl along we may see&mdash;and,
oh, it is indeed a vision!&mdash;our butcheress Marguerite
dive into a neighbouring shop. Dive in such
a connection is a poetic license, for if a description of
Marguerite must begin in military phrase it must
equally surely end in architectural. If on the front
there were two strong salients, in the rear was a flying
buttress. Marguerite&mdash;delicious irony of nomenclature&mdash;was
exceedingly short, her hair was black as
a raven's wing, her eyes were brown, and her cheeks,
full-blown, were red as a ripe, ripe cherry. Over the
salients she wore vast tracts of white apron plentifully
besmeared with blood. So were her hands, so was her
shop. It was the goriest butchery I have ever seen.
As "Madame" (I shall tell you about her later on)
did all our shopping, it was my fortune to visit Marguerite
but once a month. Had I been obliged to
visit her twice I should now be a vegetarian living
on nuts.</p>

<p>Sometimes Marguerite cast aside the loathsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
evidences of her trade and donned a smart black
costume and a velvet hat with feathers in it. Then
indeed she was the vision radiant, and never shall I
forget meeting her on the boulevard one day when a
covey of Taubes were bombing the town. Hearing
something like a traction-engine snorting behind me,
I turned and beheld Marguerite, whose walk was a fat,
plethoric waddle, panting down the street. Every
feather in her hat was stiff with fright, her mouth was
open, she was breathing like a man under an anæsthetic,
and&mdash;by the transcendental gods I swear it!&mdash;the
buttress was flying. Marguerite <span class="smcap">RAN</span>.</p>

<p>But she has a soul, though you may not believe it.
She must have, for on the reeking offal-strewn table
that adorns her shop she sets almost daily a vase of
flowers. Perhaps in spite of her offensive messiness
she doesn't really enjoy being a butcher.</p>

<p>During that first summer, although so near the
Front, Bar was rather a quiet place where soldiers&mdash;Territorials?&mdash;in
all sorts of odd uniforms drifted by
(I once saw a man in a red cap, a khaki coat, blue
trousers and knee-high yellow boots), while civilians
went placidly about their affairs. Our flat was on
the Boulevard de la Rochelle, and so on the high road
to Verdun and St Mihiel, a stroke of good luck that
sometimes interfered sadly with our work. For many
a regiment went marching by, sometimes with colours
flying and bands playing, gay and gallant, impertinent,
jolly fellows with a quip for every petticoat in the
street and a lightly blown kiss for every face at a
window. But there were days when no light jest set
the women giggling, days when the marching men
were beaten to the very earth with weariness, stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with mud, bowed beneath their packs, eyes set straight
in front of them, seeing nothing but the interminable
road, the road that led from the trenches and&mdash;at last&mdash;to
rest. Far away we could hear the ominous mutter
of the guns, now rising, now falling, now catching up
earth and air and sky into a wild clamour of sound.
No need to ask why the men did not look up as they
went by, no need to wonder at the strained, set faces.
Perhaps in their ears as in ours there rang, high
above the dull heavy burden of the cannon-song, the
thin chanting of the priests who, so many desolate
times a day, trod the road that leads to the Garden
of Sacrifice where sleep so many of the sons of France.
Ah, I can hear them now, and see the pitiful little
processions winding down from every quarter of the
town, the priest mechanically chanting, a few soldiers
grouped round the coffin, a weeping woman or two
following close behind. Of late&mdash;since Verdun, I think&mdash;the
tiny guard of honour no longer treads the road,
and the friendless soldier dying far from home goes
alone to his last resting-place upon the hill.</p>

<p>There the open graves are always waiting. The
wooden black crosses have spread far out over the
hill-side, climbing up and across till no one dare
estimate their number. Five thousand, a grave-digger
told us long, long ago. Since then Verdun has written
her name in blood across the sky, Verdun impregnable
because her rampart was the heart of the manhood
of France, Verdun supreme because the flower of that
manhood laid down their lives in order to keep her so.</p>

<p>Yes, the chanting of the priests brings an odd lump
into one's throat, but one day we saw a little ceremony
that moved us more deeply still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>It was early morning, a strain of martial music rose
on the air. We hurried to the windows and saw a
company of soldiers coming down the boulevard.
They passed our house, marched to the far end, halted,
and then turning, ranged themselves in a great semicircle
beyond the window. To say that their movements
lacked the cleanness and precision which an
English regiment would have shown is to put the matter
mildly. Their business was to form three sides of a
square. They formed it, shuffling and dodging,
elbowing, scraping their feet, falling into their places
by the Grace of God while a fat fussy officer skirmished
about for all the world like an agitated curate at a
Sunday School treat.</p>

<p>The fourth side of the square consisted of the pavement
and a crowd of women, children and lads, a
crowd with a gap in the middle where, like a rock
rising above the waters of sympathy, stood two chairs
on which two soldiers, <i lang="fr">mutilés de la guerre</i>, were sitting.
Brave men both. They had distinguished themselves
in fight, and this morning France was to do them
honour.</p>

<p>An officer read aloud something we could not hear,
and then a general stepped forward and pinned the
Croix de Guerre upon their breasts, and colonels and
staff officers shook them by the hand, and the band
broke into the Marseillaise and the watching crowd
tried to raise a cheer. But their voice died in their
throat, no sound would come, for the Song of the Guns
was in their ears and out across the hills their own
men were fighting, to come home to them, perhaps,
one day as these men had come, or it might be never
to come home at all. The cheer became a sob, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
voice of a stricken nation, of suffering heart-sick
womanhood waiting ... waiting.</p>

<p>So the band played a lively tune and the soldiers
marched away, the crowd melted silently about its
daily work and for a time the boulevard was deserted,
deserted save for him who sat huddled into his deep
arm-chair, the Croix de Guerre upon his breast and the
pitiless sunlight streaming down upon the pavements
he would never tread again.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the bands march by again. It
is evening, and the shadows are lengthening. We
mingle with the crowd and see a tall, stern man with
aloof, inflexible, unsmiling face pass up and down the
lines of the guard of honour drawn up to receive him.
A shorter, stouter man is at his side.</p>

<p>"Vive Kitchenaire!"</p>

<p>The densely packed crowds take up the cry. "Vive
l'Angleterre!" Ah, it is God Save the King that
the band is playing now. "Vive Kitchenaire."
Again the shout goes up. The short, stout man
greets the crowd, and a mighty roar responds. "Vive
Joffre." He smiles, but his companion never unbends.
As the glorious Marseillaise thunders on the
air, with unseeing eyes and ears that surely do not hear
he turns away, and the dark passage of the house
swallows him up.</p>

<p>"Vive Kitchenaire!"</p>

<p>The echoes have hardly died away when a tear-choked
voice greets me. "Ah, Mademoiselle, but the
news is bad to-day." Tears are rolling down the
little Frenchwoman's face. So deep is her grief I
fear a personal loss. But she shakes her head. No, it
is not that. She hands me a paper and, stunned, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
read the news. As I cross the street and turn towards
home the world seems shadowed. Sorrow has drawn
her veils closely about the town&mdash;sorrow for the man
whom it trusted and whose privilege it had been to
honour.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">SETTLING-IN</p>


<p>Our first duty on arriving in the town was to go
to the Bureau de Police and ask for a <i lang="fr">permis de séjour</i>.
We understood that without it there would be short
shrift and a shorter journey into a world which has
not yet been surveyed. So we sallied forth to the
Bureau at break of day, and there we interviewed an
old <i lang="fr">grognard</i>&mdash;the only really grumpy person I met in
France&mdash;who scowled at us and scolded us and called
the devil to witness that these English names are
barbarous, the chatter of monkeys, unintelligible to
any civilised ear. We soothed him with shaking
knees; suppose he refused us permission to reside
in the town? And presently he melted. He never
really liquified, you know, there was always a crust;
but once or twice on subsequent occasions a drop,
just a teeny, weeny drop of the milk of human kindness
oozed through. He demanded our photographs,
and when he saw my "finished-while-you-wait" his
belief in our Simian ancestry took indestructible form.
The number of my photographs now scattered over
France on imposing documents is incalculable, and the
number of times I have had to howl my age into
unsympathetic ears so great that all my natural
modesty in dealing with so delicate a subject has
wilted away.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">grognard</i> dismissed us at length, feeling like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the worm that perisheth, and a fortnight or so later
presented us with our <i lang="fr">permis de séjour</i> (which warned
us that any infringement of its regulations would
expose us to immediate arrest as spies), and with an
esoteric document called an <i lang="fr">Extrait du Registre d'Immatriculation</i>
whose purpose in history we were never
able to determine. No one ever asked to see it, no
one ever asked to see our <i lang="fr">permis de séjour</i>, in fact the
gendarmes of the town showed a reprehensible lack
of interest in our proceedings.</p>

<p>In addition to these we were provided as time went
on with a <i lang="fr">carte d'identité</i>, a permission to circulate on
a bicycle in districts specified, a permission to take
photographs not of military interest, and later on
with a <i lang="fr">carnet d'étranger</i> which gripped us in a tight
fist, kept us at the end of a very short chain, and made
us rue the day we were born. And of course we had
our passports as well.</p>

<p>Not being a cyclist, I used that particular permission
when tramping on the Sabbath beyond the confines
of the town. Once a bright military star tried to stop
some one who followed my example. "It is a permission
to cycle. You are on foot," he argued.</p>

<p>"But the bicycle could not get here without me,"
she replied, and her merciless logic dimmed his light.</p>

<p>As for me, I carried all my papers on all occasions
that took me past a sentry. It offended my freeborn
British independence to be held up by a blue-coated
creature with a bayonet in his hand on a road that I
choose to grace with my presence, and so I took a mild
revenge. The stoutest sentry quailed before such
evidence of rectitude, and indeed we secretly believed
that sheer curiosity prompted many a "Halte-là."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Once as I trudged a road far from Bar two gorgeous
individuals mounted on prancing chargers swept
past me. A moment later they drew rein, and with
those eyes of seventh sense that are at the back of
every woman's head I knew they were studying my
retreating form. A lunatic or a spy? Surely only
one or the other would wear that grey dress. A shout,
"Holà." I marched on. If French military police
wish to accost me they must observe at least a measure
of propriety. Again the "Holà." My shoulders
crinkled. Would a bullet whiz between? A thunder
of galloping hoofs, a horse racing by in a cloud of dust,
a swirl and a gendarme majestically barring the way.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Madame?"</p>

<p>Stifling a desire to ask what business it was of his,
I replied suavely&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Bar-le-Duc."</p>

<p>"Bar-le-Duc? But it is miles from here."</p>

<p>"Eh bien? What of it? On se promene."</p>

<p>"I must ask to see your papers."</p>

<p>Out they all came, a goodly bunch. He took them,
appalled. He fingered them; he stared.</p>

<p>"Madame is English?"</p>

<p>"But certainly? What did Monsieur suppose?"</p>

<p>The papers are thrust into my hand, he salutes,
flicks his horse with a spur, and I am alone on the
undulating road with the woods just touched by
spring's soft wing, spreading all about me.</p>

<p>But this happened when sentries and bayonets had lost
their terror. There were days when we treated them
with more respect. Familiarity breeds contempt&mdash;when
one knows that the bayonet is not sharpened.</p>

<p>Our papers in order, our heads no longer wobbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
on our shoulders, our next duty was to call on the <i lang="fr">élite</i>
of the town. In France you don't wait to be called
upon, you call. It was nerve-racking work for two
miserable foreigners, one of whom had almost no
French, while that of the other abjectly deserted her
in moments of perturbation. But we survived it,
perhaps because every one was out. Only at Madame
B.'s did we find people at home, and she&mdash;how she must
have sighed when we departed! We all laboured
heavily in the vineyard, but fright, shyness, the
barrier of language prevented us&mdash;on that day at least&mdash;from
gathering much fruit. Exhausted, humbled
to the dust, thinking of all the brilliant things we
might have said if only we could have taken the
invaluable Bellows with us, we crawled home to
seek comfort in a <i lang="fr">brioche de Lorraine</i> and a cup of
China tea which we had to make for ourselves, as
"Madame" had not yet learned the method. In
fact there were many things she had not learned,
and one of them was what the English understand by
the word rubbish. It was a subject on which for many
a day her views and ours unhappily rarely coincided.
Once we caught her in the Common-room, casting
baleful eyes on cherished treasures.</p>

<p>"Do you wish that I shall throw away these
<i lang="fr">ordures</i>, Mademoiselle?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ordures!</span> Ye gods! A bucketful of gladioli and
stocks and all sorts of delicious things gathered in
the curé's garden at Naives, and she called them
<i lang="fr">ordures</i>. With a shriek we fell upon her and her
broom. Did she not know they were flowers? What
devil of ignorance possessed her that she should call
them rubbish?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Flowers! <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>, but what does one want
with flowers in a sitting-room? The petals fall, they
are <i lang="fr">des ordures</i>." Again the insulting word.</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>like</em> flowers, Madame?" we asked, and
she turned resigned eyes to ours. These English!
Perhaps the good God who made them understood
them, but as for her, Odille Drouet ... With a shrug
she consigned us to the limbo of the inscrutable. A
garden was the place for flowers, why should we bring
them into the house?</p>

<p>French logic. Why, indeed?</p>

<p>Madame never understood us, but I think she grew
to tolerate us in the end, and perhaps even to like us
a little for our own queer sakes. Once, when she had
been with us for a few weeks, she exclaimed so bitterly,
"I wish I had never seen the English," we wondered
what we could possibly have done to offend her.
Agitated inquiries relieved our minds. We were
merely a disagreeable incident of the war. If the
Germans had not pillaged France we would not have
come to Bar-le-Duc. Cause and effect linked us with
the Boche in her mind, and I think she never looked
at us without seeing the Crown Prince leering over our
shoulder.</p>

<p>A woman of strange passivity of temper, a fatalist&mdash;like
so many of her countrymen&mdash;she had a face that
Botticelli would have worshipped. Masses of dark
hair exquisitely neat were coiled on her head (why,
oh why, do our English women wear hats? Is not
half a French woman's attraction in the simple dignity
of the uncovered head? I never realised the vulgarising
properties of hat till I lived in France), her eyes
were dark, her brows delicately pencilled, her features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
regular. Gentleness, resignation, patience were all
we saw in her. She had one of the saddest faces I
have ever seen.</p>

<p>No doubt she had good reason to be sad. Her
husband, a well-to-do farmer, died of consumption in
the years before the war, and she who now cooked and
scrubbed and dusted and tidied for us once drove her
own buggy, once ruled a comfortable house and
superintended the vagaries of three servants. In
her fine old cupboards were stores of handspun linen
sheets, sixty pairs at least, and ten or twelve dozen
handspun, handmade chemises. Six <i lang="fr">lits montés</i>
testified to the luxury of her home; on the walls
hung rare pottery, Lunéville, Sarréguemin and the
like.</p>

<p>A <i lang="fr">lit monté</i> is a definite sign of affluence, and well it
may be so. The French understand at least two
things thoroughly&mdash;sauces and beds. Incidentally
I believe that the French woman does not exist who
cannot make a good omelette. I saw one made once
in five minutes over a smoky wood fire, the pan poised
scientifically on two or three crosswise sticks. An
English woman cooking on such an altar would have
offered us an imitation of chamois leather, charred,
toughened and impregnated with smoke. Madame
the wife of the Mayor of Vavincourt offered us&mdash;dare
I describe it? Perhaps one day I shall write a
sonnet to that omelette; it must not be dishonoured
in prose.</p>

<p>Yes, the French can cook, and they can make beds,
and unless you have stretched your wearied limbs in
a real <i lang="fr">lit monté</i>, unless you have sunk fathoms deep
in its downy nest and have felt the light, exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
warmth of the <i lang="fr">duvet</i> steal through your limbs, you
have never known what comfort is.</p>

<p>You gaze at it with awe when you see it first,
wondering how you are to get in. I know women
who had to climb upon a chair every night in order
to scale the feathery heights. For my own part,
being long of limb, I found a flying leap the most
graceful means of access, but there are connoisseurs
who recommend a short ladder.</p>

<p>Piled on the top of a palliasse and a mattress are a
huge bed of feathers, spotless sheets, a single blanket,
a coverlet, and then the crimson silk-covered <i lang="fr">duvet</i>,
over which is spread a canopy of lace. The cost
must be fabulous, though oddly enough no one ever
mentioned a probable price. But no refugee can
speak of her lost <i lang="fr">lits montés</i> without tears.</p>

<p>Madame had six of them, and cattle in her byre,
and horses in her stable, and all the costly implements
of a well-stocked farm. Yet for months she lived
with her little girl, her father, and her mother in a
single room in the Place de la Halle, a dark, narrow,
grimy room that no soap and water could clean.
Her bed was a sack of straw laid upon the ground, and&mdash;until
the Society provided them&mdash;she had no sheets,
no pillow-cases, indeed I doubt if she even had a
pillow. Her farm is razed to the ground, and no doubt
some fat unimaginative sausage-filled Hausfrau sleeps
under her sheets and cuddles contentedly under her
<i lang="fr">duvet</i> o' nights.</p>

<p>The little party of four were six weeks on the road
to Bar from that farm beyond Montfaucon, and during
the whole time they never ate hot food and rarely
cooked food. No wonder Madame seldom laughed&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
those weeks of haunting fear and present misery were
never forgotten&mdash;no wonder it was months before
we shook her out of her settled apathy and saw some
life, some animation grow again in her quiet face.</p>

<p>If sometimes we felt inclined to shake her for other
reasons than those of humanity her caution was to
blame. Never did she commit herself. To every
question inviting an opinion she returned the same
exasperating reply, "C'est comme vous voulez,
Mademoiselle." I believe if we had asked her to buy
antelopes' tongues and kangaroos' tails for dinner
she would have replied equably, tonelessly, "C'est
comme vous voulez."</p>

<p>Whether the point at issue was a warm winter jacket,
or a table, or a holiday on the Sabbath, or cabbage for
dinner, the answer was always the same. Once in a
moment of excitement&mdash;but this was when she had
got used to us, and found we were not so awful as we
looked&mdash;she exclaimed, "Oh, mais taisez-vous,
Mademoiselle," and we felt as if an earthquake had
riven the town.</p>

<p>Later she developed a quiet humour, but she always
remained aloof. Unlike Madame Philipot who succeeded
her, she never showed the least interest in the
refugees who besieged our door. "C'est une dame."
The head insinuated through the door would be withdrawn
and we left to the joys of conjecture. The
"lady" might be that ragged villain from the rue
Phulpin, wife of a shepherd, a drunken dissolute
vagabond who pawned her all for liquor, or it might be
Madame B., while "C'est un Monsieur" might conceal
a General of Division, or the Service de Ville claiming
two francs for delivery of a parcel, in its cryptic folds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>She had no curiosity, vulgar or intellectual, that we
could discover. She was invariably patient, sweet-tempered,
gentle of voice, courteous of phrase. She
came to her work punctually at seven; going home,
unless cataclysms happened, at twelve. If the cataclysms
did occur, even through no fault of our own,
we felt as guilty as if we had murdered babies in their
sleep, Madame being an orderly soul who detested
irregularity. And punctually at half-past four she
would come back again, cook the dinner, wash up <i lang="fr">la
vaisselle</i> and quietly disappear at eight.</p>

<p>The manner of her going was characteristic.</p>

<p>French women seem to have a horror of being out
alone after dark (perhaps they have excellent reason
for it, they know their countrymen better than I do),
and Madame was no exception to the rule. Perhaps
she was merely bowing her head to national code,
the rigid <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, perhaps it was a question of
temperament. Anyway the fact emerged, Madame
would not walk home alone. Who, then, should
accompany her? Her parents were old and nearly
bedridden, she had no husband, brother, or friend.
The crazy English who careered about at all hours
of the day and night? We had our work to do.</p>

<p>Juliana was ordered to fetch her. This savouring
of adventure and responsibility fell in with Juliana's
mood. She consented. Now she was her mother's
younger daughter and her age was twelve. Can you
understand the psychology of it? This is how I
read it. A child was safe on the soldier-frequented
road, a mother with her child would not be intercepted,
but a good-looking woman alone&mdash;well, as the French
say, that was quite another <i lang="fr">paire de bottines</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>What would have happened had Juliana declined
the honour, I simply dare not conjecture. For that
damsel did precisely as she pleased. Her mother's
passivity, fatalism, call it what you will, was the
mainspring of all her relations with her children.
"Que voulez-vous? She wishes it." Or quite simply,
"Juliana does not wish it," closed the door against
all remonstrance. Madame was a strong-willed woman,
she never yielded an iota to us, but her children ruled.
When the elder girl, aged fourteen and well-placed
with a good family in Paris, came to Bar for a fortnight
and then refused to go back, Madame shrugged. Some
one in Paris may have been, indeed was, seriously
inconvenienced, but "Que voulez-vous?"</p>

<p>"Don't you wish her to go back, Madame?"</p>

<p>"But certainly. What should she do here? It is
not fit for a young girl, but que voul&mdash;&mdash;" We fled.</p>

<p>Parental authority seems to be a negligible quantity
in France. So far as I could see children did very
much as they liked, and were often spoiled to the verge
of objectionableness. Yet the steadfastness, courage,
thoughtfulness and whole-souled sanity of many a
young girl&mdash;or a child&mdash;would put older and wiser
heads to shame.</p>

<p>A puzzling people, these French, who refute to-morrow
nearly every opinion they tempt you to
formulate about them to-day.</p>

<p>If English women struggling with "chars" and
"generals" knew the value of a French <i lang="fr">femme de
ménage</i> there would be a stampede across the Channel
in search of her. She does your marketing much more
cheaply than you could do it yourself, she keeps her
accounts neatly, she is punctual, scrupulously honest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
dependable and trustworthy. She may not be clean
with British cleanness, her dusting may be superficial
(her own phrase, "passer un torchon," aptly describes
it), but she understands comfort, and in nearly twenty
months' experience of her I never knew a dinner spoiled
or a dish unpalatably served.</p>

<p>Of course it is arguable that Madame was not a
<i lang="fr">femme de ménage</i>, nor of the servant class at all.
Granted! But there were others. There was the
<i lang="fr">bonne à tout faire</i> (general servant) of the old curé at
N. who ruled him with a rod of iron and cooked him
dinners fit for a king. And there was Eugénie, the
Abbé B.'s Eugénie, who, loving him with a dog-like
devotion, was his counsellor and his friend. She
corrected him for his good when she thought he needed
it, but she mothered and cared for him in his exile
from his loved village&mdash;French trenches run through
it to-day&mdash;as only a single-minded woman could.</p>

<p>Yes, Madame&mdash;whether ours or some one else's&mdash;is
a treasure, and we guarded ours as the apple of our
eye. There were moments when we positively cringed
before her, so afraid were we that she might leave us;
for she hated cooking, hers having always been the
life of the fields, and though no self-respecting Frenchwoman
regards herself as a servant or as a menial,
there must have been many hours when the cruelty
of her position bit deep. Nevertheless she bore with
us for a year, and then the air raids began. And the
air raids shattered the nerves of Juliana&mdash;a brave
little soul, but delicate (we feared tainted with her
father's malady); and flight in the night to the nearest
cellar, unfortunately some distance away, brought
the shadow of Death too close to the home. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
elders counselled flight. Juliana begged to be taken
away. Madame wished to remain. The matter hung
in uncertainty for some days, then eight alarms and
two raids in twenty-four hours settled it.</p>

<p>The alarms began on Friday morning; on Saturday
Madame told us that the old people would stay in
Bar no longer and she had applied for the necessary
papers. They were going south to the Ain on the
morrow. Not a word of regret or apology for leaving
us at a moment's notice, or for giving us no time in
which to replace her. Why apologise since she could
neither alter nor prevent? She went through no wish
of her own, went at midday, just walked out as she
had done every day for a year, but came back next
morning to say good-bye and ask us to store some
odds and ends. When she had a settled address would
we send them on?</p>

<p>So she went away, and our memory of her is of one
who never fought circumstances, never wrestled with
Fate. When the storms beat upon her, when rude
winds blew, she bowed her head and allowed them to
carry her where they listed. I think the spring of
her life must have broken on that August day when
she turned her cattle out on the fields and, closing the
door behind her, walked out of her house for ever.</p>

</div>
<p class="center">THE BASKET-MAKERS OF VAUX-LES-PALAMIES</p>


<p>The long hot days of summer pursued their stifling
way, yet were all too short for the work we had in hand.
There were families to be visited, case-papers to be
written up, card-indexes to be filled in, and bales to
be unpacked. There were clothes to be sorted, there
were people in their hundreds to be fitted with coats
and trousers and shirts and underlinen and skirts
and blouses, and the thousand and one things to be
coped with in the Clothes-room. When Satan visits
Relief workers he always lives in the Clothes-room.
And there he takes a malicious delight in turning the
contents of the shelves upside down and in hiding from
view the outfit you chose so carefully yesterday evening
for Madame Hougelot, or Madame Collignon, so that
when you come to look for it in the morning, lo! it
is gone. And Madame is waiting with her six children
on the stairs, and the hall is a whirlpool of slowly-circling
humanity, who want everything under the sun
and much that is above it.</p>

<p>Truly the way of the Relief worker is hard. But
it has its compensations. You live for a month, for
instance, on one exquisite episode. You are giving
a party; you have invited some fifteen hundred guests.
You spread them out over several days, <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>,
and in the generosity of your heart you decide that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
shall have a present. You sit at the receipt of custom,
issuing your cards with the name of each guest written
thereon, and to you comes Madame Ponnain. (That
is not her real name, but it serves.) Yes, she is a refugee
and she has two children. She would like three cards.
<i lang="fr">Bon.</i> You inscribe her name, you gaze at her
questioningly.</p>

<p>"There is Georgette, she has two years."</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Bon.</i> Georgette is inscribed.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>Madame hesitates. There is the baby.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Bon.</i> His are?</p>

<p>"Eh bien, il n'est pas encore au monde."</p>

<p>You suggest that the unborn cannot ...</p>

<p>"Mais mademoiselle&mdash;si il y a des étrennes (gifts)?"</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps; one doesn't know. The Ponnains
were a people of much discrimination. He might
arrive in time. <i lang="fr">Quel dommage</i>, then, if he had no
ticket!</p>

<p>He discriminated.</p>

<p>He gets his ticket, and you register anew your
homage to French foresightfulness and thrift.</p>

<p>And then you go back to the Clothes-room. You
climb over mountains of petticoats and chemises, all
of the same size and all made to fit a child of three.
There are thousands of them, they obsess you. You
dream at night that you are smothering under a hill
of petticoats while irate refugees, whose children are
all over five and half-naked, hurl the chemises and&mdash;other
things at you, uttering round French maledictions
in ear-splitting tones. You wade through the
wretched things, you eat them, sleep them; your brain
reels, you say things about work-parties which, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
published, would cause an explosion, and the Pope
would excommunicate you and the Foreign Office hand
you your passports. You write frantic letters to headquarters,
then you grow cold, waxing sarcastic. You
hint that marriage as an institution existed in France
before 1912, and that the first baby was not born in
that year of blindfold peace. And you add a rider to
the effect that many, indeed most, of your cherished
<i lang="fr">émigrées</i> are not slum-dwellers fighting for rags at a
jumble sale, but respectable people who don't go about
in ragged trousers or with splashes of brown or yellow
paint on a blue serge dress. Then you are conscience-stricken,
for some of the bales have been packed by
Sanity, and the contents collected by Reason. There
are many white crows in the flock.</p>

<p>A ring at the door interrupts, perhaps happily, your
epistolary labours. It is the Service de Ville, a surly
person but faithful. He has six bales. They are
immense. You go down, you try to roll one up the
stairs. Your comrade in labour is four feet six and
weighs seven stone. The bale weighs&mdash;or seems to
weigh&mdash;a ton. Sisyphus is not more impotent than
you. Then an angel appears. It is Madame. "I
heard the efforts," she remarks, and indeed our puffings
and pantings and blowings and swearings must have
been audible almost at the Front. She puts her solid
shoulder under the bale. It floats lightly up the stairs.
Then you begin to unpack. It is dirty work, and
destroys the whiteness of your hands. Never mind.
Remember <i lang="fr">les pauvres émigrées</i>, and that we are <i lang="fr">si
devouée</i>, you know.</p>

<p>Everything under heaven has, I verily believe,
come at one time or another out of our bales&mdash;except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
live stock and joints of beef. Concertinas in senile
decay, mandolines without keys, guitars without
strings, jam leaking over a velvet gown, tons of old
newspapers and magazines&mdash;all English, of course, and
subsequently sold as waste-paper, hats that have
braved many a battle and breeze, boots without soles,
ball dresses, satin slippers (what <span class="smcap">do</span> people think
refugees need in the War Zone?), greasy articles of
apparel, the mere handling of which makes our fingers
shine, dirty underlinen, single socks and stockings,
married socks that are like the Irishman's shirt&mdash;made
of holes, another hundred dozen of petticoats for
children aged three, and once&mdash;how we laughed over it!&mdash;a
red velvet dress that I swear had been filched from
an organ-grinder's monkey, and with it a pair of-of&mdash;well,
you know. They were made of blue serge,
and when held out at width stretched all across the
Common-room. The biggest Mynheer that ever
smoked a pipe by the Zuyder Zee would have been
lost in them, and as they were neither male nor female,
only some sort "of giddy harumphrodite" could have
worn them.</p>

<p>Sometimes we fell upon stale cough lozenges, on
mouldering biscuits, on dried fruits, on chocolate, on
chewing-gum, on moth-eaten bearskin rugs, or on a
brilliant yellow satin coverlet with LOVE in large green
capitals on it. The tale is unending, but it was not
all tragic. There were many days when our hearts
sang in gladness, when good, useful, sensible things
emerged from the bales and we fitted our people out
in style.</p>

<p>But all the rubbish in the world must have been
dumped upon France in the last two years. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
has there been such a sweeping out of cupboards, such
a rummaging of dust-bins. The hobble skirts that
submerged us at one period nearly drove us into an
early grave. Picture us, with a skirt in hand. It is
twenty-seven inches round the tail, perhaps twenty-three
round the waist. And Madame, who waits with
such touching confidence in the discrimination of
Les Anglaises, tells you that she is <i lang="fr">forte</i>. As you look
at her you believe it. It is half a day's journey to walk
round her. You pace the wide circle thoughtfully,
you make rapid calculations, you give it up. The thing
simply cannot be done. And you send up a wild prayer
that before ever there comes another war French
women of the fields will take to artificial means of
restraining their figures. As it is, like Marguerite,
many of them occupy vast continents of space when
they take their walks abroad. And when they stand
on the staircase, smiling deprecatingly at you, and
you have nothing that will fit....</p>

<p>And when it does fit it is blue, or green, and they
have a passion for black. Something discreet. Something
they can go to Mass in. I often wonder why they
worship their God in such dolorous guise. Something,
too, they can mourn in. So many are <i lang="fr">en deuil</i>. Once
a woman who came for clothes demanded black, refusing
a good coat because it was blue. The cousin of
her husband had died five months before, and never
had she been able to mourn him. If the English would
give her <i lang="fr">un peu de deuil</i>? She waited weeks. She
got it and went forth smiling happily upon an
appreciative world, ready to mourn at last.</p>

<p>The weather is stifling, the Clothes-room an inferno.
The last visitor for the morning has been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
contentedly away&mdash;she may come back to-morrow,
though, and tell us that the dress of Madeleine does
not fit, and may she have one the same as that which
Madame Charton got? Now the dress of Madame
Charton's Marie was new and of good serge, whereas
that of Madeleine was slightly worn and of light summer
material. But then Marie had an old petticoat,
whereas Madeleine had a new one. But this concession
to equality finds no favour in the eyes of Madeleine's
mother. She has looked upon the serge and
lusted after it. We suggest that a tuck, a little
arrangement.... She goes away. And in the house
in rue Paradis there is lamentation, and Marie, I grieve
to say, lifts up her shrill treble and crows. It is one
of the minor tragedies of life. Alas, that there are
so many!</p>

<p>But as Madame the mother of Madeleine departs,
we know nothing of the reckoning that waits us on the
morrow. We only know that we promised to go and
see the Basket-makers to-day, that time is flying, and
haste suicidal with the thermometer at steaming-point.</p>

<p>"Madame, we are going out. We cannot see any
one else."</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Bon.</i> Madame is a Cerberus. She will write down
the names of callers and so ease our minds while we are
away.</p>

<p>We fling on our hats, we arm ourselves with pencil
and notebook, and wend our way up the Avenue du
Château to the rue des Ducs de Bar. It is well to
choose this route sometimes, though it is longer than
that of the rue St. Jean, for it goes past the old gateway
and shows you the view over the rue de Véel. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
is wise to look down on the rue de Véel; it is rather
foolhardy to walk in it. For motor-lorries whiz
through it at a murderous speed, garbage makes
meteoric flights from windows, the drainage screams
to Heaven, every house is a tenement house, most of
them are foul and vermin-ridden, and all are packed
with refugees.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps not quite all. Even the rue de Véel
has its bright particular spots, one of them being the
house, set a little back from the street, in which Pétain,
"On-les-aura Pétain," lived during the battle of
Verdun. The street lies in a deep hollow, with cultivated
hills rising steeply above it. Higher up there
are woods on the far side, while above the sweeping
Avenue du Château the houses are piled one above the
other in tumbled, picturesque confusion.</p>

<p>Once in the rue des Ducs we go straight to No. 49,
through a double-winged door into a courtyard, up a
flight of worn steps into a wee narrow lobby, rather
dark and noisome, and then, if any one cries <i lang="fr">Entrez</i>!
in response to our knock, into a great wide room.</p>

<p>That some one would cry it is certain, for the room
is a human hive. It swarms with people. Short,
thickset, sturdy, rather heavily-built people, whose
beauty is not their strong point, but whose honesty is.
And another, for they have many, is their industry;
and yet another, dear to the heart of the Relief worker,
is their gratitude for any little help or sympathy that
may be given them.</p>

<p>And, poor souls, they did need help. Think of it!
One room the factory, dining-room, bedroom, smoking-room,
sitting-room of forty people. Some old, some
young. Women, girls and men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>It appalled you as you went in. On one side, down
all its length, and also along the top palliasses were laid
on the floor, so close they almost touched. Piled
neatly on these were scanty rugs or blankets. No
sheets or linen of any kind until our Society provided
them. There was only one bed&mdash;a gift from the
Society&mdash;and in that sat a little old woman bolt upright.
Her skin was the colour of old parchment, it
was seamed and lined and criss-crossed with wrinkles,
for she was over eighty years of age. But her spirit
was still young. She could enjoy a little joke.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember the war of Soixante-dix," she
said, "but it was not like this. Ma fois, non! Les
Prussiens&mdash;oh, they were good to us." Her eyes
twinkled. "They lived in our house. They were like
children."</p>

<p>"Madame, Madame! Confess now that 'vous avez
fait la coquette' with those Prussians."</p>

<p>Whereupon she cackled a big, "Ho, ho! Écoutez
ce qu'elle dit!" and a shrivelled finger poked me
facetiously in the ribs.</p>

<p>But if the Basket-makers made friends with the
Germans in those far-off days, they hate them now.
Hate them with bitter, deadly hatred. "Ah, les
barbares! les sauvages! les rosses!" Madame Walfard
would cry, her face inflamed with anger. Her mother,
badly wounded by a shell, had become paralysed, so
there is perhaps some excuse for her venom.</p>

<p>But for the most part they are too busy to waste
time in revilings. The little old woman is the only idle
person in the room. Squatting on low stools under the
windows&mdash;there are four or five set in the length of the
wall&mdash;the rest work unceasingly, small basins of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
sheaves of osier, tools, finished baskets, and piles of
osier-ends strewn all about them. Down the middle
of the room runs a long table, littered with mugs,
bowls, cooking utensils, odds and ends of every description.
There is only one stove, a small one, utterly
inadequate for the size of the room. On it all their
cooking has to be done. I used to wonder if they
ever quarrelled.</p>

<p>As time went on and I came to know them better,
Madame Malhomme and Madame Jacquemot told me
many a tale of their life in Vaux-les-Palamies, of the
opening days of war and of their subsequent flight
from their village. Madame Malhomme, daughter of
the little old lady who had once dared to flirt with a
Prussian, lived in the big room in the rue Des Ducs for
nearly a year. Then Madame B. established her and
her family in a little house about half a mile from the
town, where they had nothing to trouble them save the
depredations of an occasional rat, a negligible nuisance
compared with the (in more senses than one) overcrowded
condition of No. 49. For that historic
mansion had gathered innumerable inmates to its
breast during the long years of emptiness and decay.
And these inmates made the Basket-makers' lives a
burden to them.</p>

<p>The cold, too, was penetrating, it ate through their
scanty clothes, it bit through flesh to the very bone.
The stove was an irony, a tiny flame in a frozen desert.
Every one was perished, Madame Malhomme not
least of all, for, seeing her daughter shivering, she
stripped off her only petticoat and forced her to put
it on.</p>

<p>At night they lay in their clothes under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
miserable blankets. (Bar-le-Duc is not a very large
nor a very rich town, and in giving what it did to such
numbers of people it showed itself generous indeed.
In ordinary times its population is not more, and is
probably less, than 17,000, so an influx of 4000 destitute
refugees taxed it heavily.)</p>

<p>The unavoidable publicities of their existence filled
the women with shame and dismay. Sleeping "comme
des bêtes sur la paille,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or, more often still, lying awake
staring out into the unfriendly dark, what dreams,
what memories must have been theirs! How often
they must have seen the village, its cosy little homes,
each with its garden basking in the sun, the river
flowing by, and the great osier beds that were the
pride of them all.</p>

<p>They seem to have lived very much to themselves,
these sturdy artisans, rarely leaving their valley, and
intermarrying to an unusual extent. You find the
same names cropping up again and again: Jacquemot,
Riot, or Malhomme. Like Quakers, every one seemed
to be the cousin of every one else. And they were
well-to-do. It is safe to presume that there was no
poverty in the village. Their baskets were justly
famous throughout France, and the average family
wage was about £3 a week. In addition they had
the produce of their garden, the inevitable pig being
fattened for the high destiny of the <i lang="fr">soupe au lard</i>,
rabbits and poultry. If Heaven denied them the gift
of physical beauty it had not been niggardly in other
respects. Best of all, it gave them the gift of labour.
In the spring pruning and tending the osier, then
cutting it, and piling it into great stacks which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to be saturated with water every day during the hot
weather, planting and digging in their gardens, looking
after the rabbits and the pig, and in winter plying
their trade. Life moved serenely and contentedly in
Vaux-les-Palamies until the dark angel of destruction
passed over it and brushed it with his wings.</p>

<p>The Basket-makers don't like the Boche; indeed,
they entertain a reasonable prejudice against him.
He foisted himself upon them, making their lives a
burden to them; he was coarse, brutal and overbearing,
he no more considered their feelings than he would
those of a rotten cabbage-stalk thrown out upon the
refuse-heap of a German town. He stayed with them
for a week. When he went away he bequeathed them
a prolific legacy. Madame Malhomme will tell you of
it if you ask her&mdash;at least she will when she knows
you well. She is not proud of it.</p>

<p>"Ah, qu'ils sont sales, ces Boches," she says with
a shudder. She bought insecticide, she was afraid to
look her neighbours in the face. It did not occur to
her at first that her troubles were not personal and
individual. Then one day she screwed up her courage
and asked the question. The answers were all in the
affirmative. No one was without.</p>

<p>So when news came that the Boche was returning,
Vaux-les-Palamies girded up its loins and fled. Shells
were falling on the village, so they dared not spend time
in extensive packings; in fact, they made little if any
attempt to pack at all. Madame's sister-in-law was
wounded in the shoulder, and the wound, untended for
days, began to crawl. Her description of it does not
remind you of a rose-scented garden. It was thrust
on me as a privilege. So was a view of the shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
The latter was no longer crawling. It was exquisitely
white and clean, but it had a hole in it into which a child
might drive its fist.</p>

<p>And so after much tribulation they found themselves
in Bar-le-Duc, and theirs was the only instance that
came under our notice of a village emigrating <i lang="fr">en masse</i>,
and settling itself tribally into its new quarters. Even
the Mayor came with them, and it was he who eventually
succeeded in getting a supply of osier and
putting them into touch with a market again. But
their activities are sadly restricted, and they make
none of their famous baskets <i lang="fr">de fantaisie</i> now, the
osier being dear and much of it bad, so their profit is
very, very small.</p>

<p>I was in Bar for some months before I met Madame
Jacquemot. And then it was Madame B. who introduced
me to her. Her mother, an old lady of eighty-two,
had been in hospital; was now rather better, and
back again with her family in the rue Maréchale.
Would the Society give her sheets? As the dispenser
of other people's bounty I graciously opined that it
would, and calling on Madame Jacquemot, told her so.
Her mother was startlingly like the old lady at No. 49,
small, thin, wiry, and bird-like in her movements.
She had had shingles, poor soul, and talked of the
<i lang="fr">ceinture de feu</i> which had scorched her weary little
body. She talked of the Germans too. Ah, then you
should have seen her! How her eyes flashed! She
would straighten herself and all her tiny frame would
become infused with a majesty, a dignity that transfigured
her. Once a German soldier demanded something
of her, and when she told him quite truthfully
that she had not got it, he doubled his fist and dealt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
her a staggering blow on the breast. And she was
such a little scrap of humanity, just an old, old woman
with a brave, tender heart and the cleanest and
honestest of souls. She got her sheets and a good
warm shawl&mdash;I am afraid we took very special trouble
with that <i lang="fr">paquet</i>, choosing the best of our little gifts
for her&mdash;and soon afterwards I went to see her again.
As we sat in the dusky room while Madame Jacquemot
told stories, describing the method of cultivating the
osier, showing how the baskets are made, the old lady
began to cough and "hem" and make fluttering
movements with her hands. Madame Jacquemot,
thickset and broad-beamed like most of her people&mdash;she
had a fleshy nose and blue eyes, I remember, hair
turning grey, a pallid, rather unhealthy complexion and
a humorous mouth&mdash;got up, and going to an inner room
returned almost immediately with a quaintly-shaped
basket in her hands. The old lady took it from her
and held it out to me.</p>

<p>"It is for you," she said. "And when you go home
to England you will tell people that it was made for
you by an old woman of eighty-two, a refugee, who
was ill and in hospital for months. I chose the osier
specially, there is not a bad bit in the basket. And
it is long, long since I have made a basket. I haven't
made one since we left home. But I wanted to make
one for you because you have been kind to us."</p>

<p>I have that basket now; I shall keep it always and
think of the feeble fingers that twined the osier, fingers
that were never to twine it again, for the gallant spirit
that fought so gamely was growing more and more
weary. The old bear transplanting badly, they yearn
for their chimney corner and the familiar things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
are all their world. The long exile from her beloved
village told upon her heart, joy fell from her and,
saddened and desolate, she slipped quietly away.</p>

<p>"She just fluttered away like a little bird," her
daughter said, and I was glad to know she had not
suffered at the last.</p>

<p>"Ah, if only I could see the village again," she would
often say. "If only I might be buried there. To die
here, among strangers.... Ah, mademoiselle, do you
think the war will soon be over? Si seulement...."
To die and be buried among her own people. To die
at home. It was all she asked for, all she had left to
wish for in the world. She would look at me with
imploring, trustful eyes. Les Anglaises, they must
know. Surely I could tell her? And in the autumn
one would say, "It will be over in the spring," and in
the winter cry, "Ah yes, in the summer." But spring
came and summer followed, and still the guns reverberated
across the hills, and winter came and the
Harvest of Death was still in the reaping.</p>

<p>Surely God must have His own Roll of Honour for
those who have fallen in the war, and many a humble
name that the world has never heard of will be written
on it in letters of gold.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">IN WHICH WE PLAY TRUANT</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Without wishing in the least to malign my fellow-men,
I am minded to declare that a vast percentage of
them are hypocrites. Not that they know it or would
believe you if you told them so. Your true <i lang="fr">poseur</i>
imposes acutely on himself, believing implicitly in his
own deceptions; but the discerning mind is ever swift
to catch an attitude, and never more so than when it
is struck before the Mirror of Charity.</p>

<p>Consequently, when people tell me they go to the
War Zone in singleness of purpose, anxious only to
succour the stricken, I take leave to be incredulous.
The thing is impossible. Every one who isn't a slug
likes to go to the War Zone, every one who isn't an
animated suet-pudding wants to see a battlefield, or a
devastated village, or a trench, or a dug-out, and we
all want <i lang="fr">souvenirs de la guerre</i>, shell cases, bits of
bomb or shrapnel, the head of the Crown Prince on a
charger, or the helmet of a Death's Head Hussar.
And do we not all love adventure, and variety&mdash;unless
fear has made imbeciles of us, and the chance of
distinguishing ourselves, of winning the Legion of
Honour in a shell-swept village, or the Croix de Guerre
under the iron rain of a Taube?</p>

<p>I believe we do, though few of us confess it. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
prefer to look superior, to pretend we "care nothing
for all that," and so I cry, "Hypocrites! Search your
hearts for your motives and you will find them as
complex as the machinery that keeps you alive."</p>

<p>Search mine for my motive and you will find it
compounded of many simples, but of their nature and
composition it is not for me to speak. Has it not
been written that I am a modest woman?</p>

<p>And methinks indifferent honest. That is why I
am going to tell you about Villers-aux-Vents. You
must not labour under a delusion that life was all hard
work and no play in the War Zone.</p>

<p>It was no high-souled purpose that led us to Villers.
It was just curiosity, common curiosity. Later on we
spent a night (Saturday night, of course) at Greux, and
visited the shrine of Jeanne D'Arc at Domremy, but
that was not out of curiosity. It was hero-worship
coupled with a passion for historical research.</p>

<p>And we planned to go to Toul and Nancy. Now
when people make plans they should carry them out.
The gods rarely send the dish of opportunity round a
second time, and when the <i lang="fr">Carnet d'Étranger</i> chained
us body and soul to <i lang="fr">l'autorité compétente militaire</i>
there was no second time. The dish had gone by; it
would never come again.</p>

<p>Wherefore I am wrath with the gods, and still more
wrath with myself, for I have not seen Nancy, and I
have not seen Toul, and if the old <i lang="fr">grognard</i> had been
in good humour I might even have gone to Verdun.
Maddening, isn't it? Especially as then, when our
work was only, so to speak, getting into its stride, we
might have virtuously spared the time. Later on
when it increased, and when we bowed to a <i lang="fr">Directrice</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
who has found the secret of perpetual motion, we
worked Saturday, Sundays and all sometimes; but
in 1915 we were not yet super-normal men. We could
still enjoy a holiday. And so we decided to go to
Villers-aux-Vents. To go before winter had snatched
the gold mantle from the limbs of autumn, to go while
yet the sun was high and the long day stretched before
us, languorous, beautiful.</p>

<p>And the manner of our going was thus, by train to
Révigny at 7.20 a.m., and then on foot over the road.</p>

<p>Now it is written that if you get into a westward-bound
omnibus train at Bar-le-Duc, in fulness of time
you will arrive at Révigny. The train will be packed
with soldiers, so of course you travel first-or second-class,
thereby incurring a small measure of seclusion
and a larger one of boredom. In Class Three it is
never dull. You may be offered cakes or a hunk of
bread which has entered into unwilling alliance with
sausage, you may be invited to drink the health of the
Allies in rank red wine, or you may be offered a faithful
heart, lifelong adoration and an income of five sous a
day. Or (but for this you must keep your ears wide
open, for the train makes <i lang="fr">un bruit infernale</i>, and speech
is a rapid, vivacious, eager thing in France) you may
hear tales of the war, episodes of the trenches, comments
upon the method of the Boche, things many of
them hardly fit for publication but drawn naked and
quivering from the wells of life.</p>

<p>Unless he has been refreshing a vigorous thirst, the
poilu is rarely unmanageable. He is the cheekiest
thing in the universe, he has a twinkle in his eye that
can set a whole street aflame, and he is filled with an
accommodating desire to go with you just as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
you please. Nevertheless, he can take a hint quicker
than any man I know, and his genius in extricating
himself from a difficult situation is that of the inspired
tactician.</p>

<p>Madame B., pursuing her philanthropic way, came
out of a shop one day to find a spruce poilu comfortably
ensconced in her carriage. With arms folded
and legs crossed he surveyed the world with conquering
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am coming for a drive with you," he remarked
genially, and his smile was the smile of a seductive
angel, his assurance that of a king.</p>

<p>"Au contraire," replied Madame B. (the poilu was
not for her, as for us, an undiscovered country bristling
with possibilities of adventure), and his abdication was
the most graceful recorded in history.</p>

<p>Now, I wouldn't advise you to accept every offer of
companionship you get from a poilu, but you may
accept some. More than one tedious mile of road is
starred for me with memories of childlike, simple souls,
burning with curiosity about all things English, and
above all about the independent female bipeds who
have no apparent fear of man, God or devil, nor even&mdash;<i lang="fr">bien
entendu</i>&mdash;of that most captivating of all created
things, the blue-coated, trench-helmeted French soldier.</p>

<p>"You march well, Mademoiselle; you would make a
fine soldier." Thus a voice behind me as I swung
homewards down the hill one chilly evening. A sense
of humour disarms me on these occasions. One day,
no doubt, it will lead me into serious trouble. I didn't
wither him. One soon learns when east winds should
blow, and when the sun, metaphorically speaking, may
shine. We walked amicably into Bar together, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
before we parted he told me all about the little wife
who was waiting for him in Paris, and the fat baby
who was <i lang="fr">tout-à fait le portrait de son père</i>.</p>

<p>So ponder long and carefully before you choose your
carriage, but if your ponderings are as long as this
digression you will never get to Révigny. Even an
omnibus train starts some time, and generally when
you least expect it.</p>

<p>At Mussey if you crane your head out of the window
you may see two wounded German prisoners, white-faced,
mud-caked wretches who provoke no comment.
At Révigny you will see soldiers (if I told you how many
pass through in a day the Censor would order me to be
immersed in a vat of official ink); and you will see
ruins. The Town Hall is an eyeless skeleton leering
down the road, the Grande Place&mdash;there is no Grande
Place, there is only a scattered confusion of fire-charred
stones and desiccated brick.</p>

<p>It was rather foggy that Sunday morning and the
town looked used up. Not an attractive place in its
palmiest days we decided as we slung our luncheon
bags over our shoulders and set out for Villers. Away
to the left we could see Brabant-le-Roi, and it was
there some weeks later that I assisted at the incineration
of a pig. He lay by the roadside in a frame of
blazing straw. Flames lapped his ponderous flanks,
and swept across his broad back, blue smoke curled
around him, an odour of roasting pig hung in the air.
A crowd of women and soldiers stood like devotees
about a shrine. The flames leaped, and fell. Then
came men who lifted him up and laid him on a stretcher.
In his neck there was a gaping wound, and out of the
fire that refined him he was no longer an Olympian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
sacrifice, he was mouldering pig, dead pig, black pig,
nauseating, horrible. I turned to fly, but a voice
detained me.</p>

<p>"Madame Bontemps will be killing to-morrow. If
Mademoiselle would like to see?"</p>

<p>But "to-morrow" Mademoiselle was happily far
on her way to Troyes, and the swan-song of Madame
Bontemps' <i lang="fr">gros cochon</i> fell on more appreciative ears.</p>

<p>However, on that Sunday morning in September
there was no pig, and our "satiable curiosity" led us
far from poor battered Brabant. Our road was to the
right and "uphill all the way." The apple trees on
the Route Nationale were crusted with ripe red fruit,
but we resisted temptation, our only loot being a shell-case
which we discovered in a field, which was exceedingly
heavy and with which we weighted ourselves for
the sake of an enthusiastic youngster at home. My
arm still aches when I think of that shell-case, for by
this time the sun had burst out, it was torridly hot,
the apple trees gave very little shade, and our too, too
solid flesh was busily resolving itself into a dew.</p>

<p>However, we persevered, the object of our pilgrimage
being a square hole dug in a sunny orchard on the
brow of the hill above Villers. Some rude earthen
steps gave access to it, the roof was supported by two
heavy beams, and the floor and sides were lined with
carved panels wrenched from priceless old <i lang="fr">armoires</i>
taken from the village. It is known as the Crown
Prince's Funk Hole, and the story goes that from its
shelter he ordered, and subsequently watched, the
destruction of the village. The dug-out, a makeshift
affair, the Crown Prince's tenancy being of short
duration, is well placed. The hill falls away behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
it, running at right angles to the opening there is a
thick hedge, trees shelter it, the line of a rough trench
or two, now filled in, runs protectingly on its flank.
The fighting in this region was open, a war of movement
lasting only a few days, so trench lines are not
very plentiful. Just opposite the mouth of the dug-out
there is a fenced-in cross, a red <i lang="fr">képi</i> hangs on the
point, a laurel wreath tied with tri-coloured ribbon
is suspended from the arms. "An unknown French
soldier." Did he fall there in the rush of battle, or
did he creep up hoping to get one clean neat shot at
the Prince of Robbers and so put him out of action
for ever?</p>

<p>As for Villers itself, it was wiped out of existence.
One house, and only one, remains, and even that is
battered. One might speculate a little on the psychology
of houses. The pleasant fire-cracker pastilles
that wrought so much havoc elsewhere were impotent
here. The Germans flung in one after another, we
were told, using every incendiary device at their
disposal, but that house refused to burn. There it
stands triumphantly in its tattered garden, not far from
the church, and when I saw it an old woman with a
reaping-hook in her hand was standing by the hedge
watching me with curious eyes. We had separated,
my companion and I, farther down the long village
street, she to meditate among the ruins, I to mourn
over the shattered belfry-tower, the bell hurled to the
ground, the splintered windows, the littered ruined
interior. In the cemetery were many soldiers' graves;
on one inscribed, "Two unknown German officers,"
some one had scribbled "À bas les Boches," the only
instance that came to my knowledge of the desecration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of a German grave. And even here contrition
followed fast upon the heels of anger, and heavy
scrawlings did their best to obliterate the bitter little
phrase. The French&mdash;in the Marne at least&mdash;have
been scrupulous in their reverence for the German
dead, the graves are fenced in just as French graves
are, and the name whenever possible printed on the
cross. I suppose that even the soppiest sentimentalist
would not ask that they should be decorated with
flowers?</p>

<p>As I left the graveyard and looked back at the desolation
that once was Villers, but where even now wooden
houses were springing hopefully from the ground, the
old woman with the reaping-hook spoke to me. My
dress betrayed me; she knew without asking that I
was British. And, as is the way with these French
peasants, she fell easily and naturally into her story.
I wish I could tell it to you just as she told it to me,
but I know I shall never find her simple dignity of
phrase, or her native instinct for the <i lang="fr">mot juste</i>. However,
such as it is you shall have it, and if it please
you not, skip. That refuge is always open to the bored
or tired reader.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Old Madame Pierrot was disturbed in spirit. She
could see the flames leaping above burning villages
across the plain, the earth shook with the menace of
the guns, the storm was rising, every moment brought
the waves of the encroaching sea nearer to her home.
Yet people said that Villers was safe. The Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
could never get so far as that, they would be turned
back long before they reached the hill. She was alone
in her comfortable two-storied house (the house she
had built only a few years before, and which had a fine
yard behind it closed in by spacious stables, cow-houses
and barns), and she was sadly in need of advice.
She had no desire whatever to make the personal
acquaintance of any German invader. Even the
honour of receiving the Crown Prince made no appeal
to her soul. She had heard something of his arch
little ways and his tigerish playfulness, and though
she could hardly suppose that he would favour a woman
of her dried and lean years with special attention, she
reasonably feared that she might be called on to assist
at one of his festivals. And an Imperial degenerate
will do that in public which decent women are ashamed
to talk about, much less to witness. So Madame was
perturbed in soul. The battle raged through the woods
and over the plain, it crept nearer ... nearer....</p>

<p>"Madame, Madame, come. Is it that you wish the
Germans to get you?" A wagon was drawn up at
the door, in it were friends who lived higher up the
street. "Come with us to Laimont. You will be
safer there."</p>

<p>So they called to her and put an end to her doubt.
Snatching up a basket, she stuffed into it all the money
she had in the house, various family papers and documents,
and then, just as she was, in her felt-soled
slippers with her white befrilled cap on her head, in
her cotton dress without even a shawl to cover her, she
clambered into the wagon and set out. Laimont
was only a few miles away; indeed, I think you can see
the church spire and the roofs of the houses from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
hill. There the wagon halted. In a few hours the
Germans would be gone, and then one could go peaceably
home again. But time winged away, the battle
raged more fiercely than ever, soon perhaps Laimont
itself would be involved and see hand-to-hand fighting
in its streets.</p>

<p>Laimont! Madame was <i lang="fr">desolée</i>. <i lang="fr">Où aller?</i> Farther
south, farther east? The Germans were everywhere.
And <i lang="fr">voyager comme ça</i> in her old felt slippers,
in her working clothes, without wrap or cloak to cover
her? Impossible. The wagon must wait. There
was still time. <i lang="fr">Ces salauds</i> would not reach Laimont
yet. Why, look! Villers itself was free. There was
no fire, no smoke rising on the hill. Her friends would
wait while she went back <i lang="fr">au grand galop</i> to put on her
boots, and her bonnet and her Sunday clothes. "Hé,
mon Dieu, it is not in the petticoat of the fields that
one runs over France."</p>

<p>Away she went, her friends promising to wait for
her. Laden down by the shell, we who were lusty and
strong found the road from Villers to Laimont unendingly
long, yet no grisly fears gnawed at our heart-strings,
no sobs rose chokingly to be thrust back
again ... and yet again. Nor had we the hill to
climb, and no shells were bursting just ahead. So
what can it have been for Madame? But she pressed
on; old, tired and, oh, so dismayed, she panted up the
steep hill that curls into the village, and walked right
into the arms of the Crown Prince's men. In a trice
she was a prisoner, one of eighty, some of whom were
soldiers, the rest civilians, who, like herself, had committed
the egregious folly of being born west of the
Rhine, and were now about to suffer for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>What particular crime Villers-aux-Vents had committed
to merit destruction I cannot tell. Perhaps it
never committed any. The Crown Prince was not
always a minister of Justice promulgating sentence
upon crime. He was more often a Nero loving a good
red blaze for its own sake, or it may be an æsthete of
emotion, a super-sensualist of cruelty, or just a devil
hot from the stones of hell.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, Villers was doomed. Out
came the pastilles and the petrol-sprayers: the most
determined destruction was carried on. Not only
were the houses themselves destroyed but the outhouses,
the stables, solid brick and mortar constructions
running back to a depth of several feet. And I
gathered that the usual pillage inaugurated the reign
of fire.</p>

<p>Of this, however, Madame knew nothing. She and
her seventy-nine companions in misery were marched
away to the north, mile after mile to Stenay, and if
you look at the map you will see that the distance is
not small, it was a march of several days.</p>

<p>Madame, as I have told you, was old, and her slippers
had soles of felt, and so the time came when her feet
were torn and bleeding, and when, famished and exhausted,
she could no longer keep step with her guards.
Her pace became slower and slower. Ah, God, what
was that? Only the butt-end of a rifle falling heavily
across her back. She nerved herself for another effort,
staggered on to falter once more. Again the persuasion
of the rifle. Again the shrewd, cruel blow, and
a bayonet flashing under her eyes.</p>

<p>A diet of black bread three times a day does not
encourage one to take violent exercise, but black bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was all that they got, and I think the rifle-butts worked
very hard during that long weary march.</p>

<p>On arrival they were herded into a church and then
into a prison, where they were brutally treated at
first, but subsequently, when French people were put
in charge, found life a little less intolerable. And later
on some residents still living in the town were kind to
her, but during all the months&mdash;some eight or nine&mdash;that
she was imprisoned there she had no dress but the
one, nothing to change into, nothing to keep out the
sharp winter cold.</p>

<p>Madame Walfard the basket-maker told me some
gruesome tales about Stenay, and what happened
there, but this is not a book of atrocities. Perhaps
it ought to be, perhaps every one who is in a position
to do so should cry aloud the story in a clear clarion
call to the civilised world, but&mdash;isn't the story
known? Can anything I have to say add a fraction
of a grain of weight to the evidence already collected?
Is the world even now so immature in its judgment
that it supposes that the men who sacked Louvain,
the men who violated Belgium behaved like gallant
gentlemen in the sunnier land of France? Do we not
know all of us that, added to the deliberate German
method, there was the lasciviousness of drunkenness?
That the Germans poured into one of the richest wine-growing
countries in the world during one of the hottest
months of the year, that their thirst at all times is a
mighty one, and when excited by the frenzy of battle
it was unassuageable? They drank, and they drank
again. They rioted in cellars containing thousands
of bottles of good wine, and they emerged no longer
men but demons, whose officers laughed to see them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
come forth, sure now that no lingering spark of human
or divine fire would hold them back from frightfulness.</p>

<p>Of course we know it was so, and therefore I am
not going to dilate upon horrors. Let the kharma
of the Germans be their witness and their judge. Only
this in fairness should be told&mdash;that the behaviour of
the men varied greatly in different regiments. "It
all depended upon the Commandant," summed up
one narrator, "and the first armies were the worst."</p>

<p>"And the Crown Prince's army?" I asked; "what
of that?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. What can be expected from the
followers of such a leader? Their exploits put mediæval
mercenaries to shame.</p>

<p>Stenay must find another historian; but even while
I refuse to become the chronicler of atrocities, every
line I write rises up to confute me. For was not the
very invasion of France an "atrocity"? Is the word
so circumscribed in its meaning that it contains only
arson, murder and rape? Does not the refinement of
suffering inflicted upon every refugee, upon every
homeless <i lang="fr">sinistré</i>, upon the basket-makers of Vaux-les-Palamies
as upon Madame Lassanne, and poor old
creatures like the Leblans fall within it too, and would
not the Germans stand convicted before the Tribunal
of such narratives even if the gross sins of the uncivilised
beast had never been laid at their door?</p>

<p>Madame Pierrot told me nothing about Stenay&mdash;perhaps
she saw nothing but the inside of her prison
walls&mdash;but she told me a great deal about the kindness
of the Swiss when she crossed the frontier one happy
day, and the joy-bells were ringing in her heart. They
gave her food and drink, they overwhelmed her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
sympathy, they offered her clothes. But Madame
said no. She was a <i lang="fr">propriétaire</i>, she had good land in
Villers.</p>

<p>"Keep the clothes for others, they will need them
more than I. In my house at Villers-aux-Vents there
are <i lang="fr">armoires</i> full of linen and underclothing, everything
that I need. I can wait."</p>

<p>I often wonder whether realisation came to her at
Révigny, or whether, all ignorant of the tragedy, she
walked blithely up the hill, the joy-bells ringing their
Te Deum in her heart, her thoughts flitting happily
from room to room, from <i lang="fr">armoire</i> to <i lang="fr">armoire</i>, conning
over again the treasures she had been parted from so
long. Did she know only as she turned the last sharp
bend in the road and saw the village dead at her feet?
Ah, whether she knew as she trudged over the much-loved
road, or whether knowledge came only with
sight, what a home-coming was that! She found the
answer to the eternal question, "What shall we find
when we return?" ... How many equally poignant
answers still lie hidden in the womb of time to be
brought forth in anguish when at last the day of
restoration comes?</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>Even the longest story must come to an end some
time, and so did Madame Pierrot's. Conscience, tugging
wildly at the strings of memory, spoke to me of my
lost comrade; the instinct of hospitality asserted itself
in Madame's soul. We were strangers, we must see
the sights. Would I go with her to her "house," and
to the dug-out of the Crown Prince? Yes? <i lang="fr">Bon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Allons.</i> And away we trotted to gather up the lost
one among the ruins, to inspect the dug-out, to eat
delicious little plums which Madame gathered for us
in the orchard, and finally to be seized by the pangs
of a righteous hunger which simply shrieked for food.
Where should we eat? Madame mourned over her
brick and rubble. If we had come before the war she
would have given us a <i lang="fr">déjeuner</i> fit for a king. A good
soup, an omelette, <i lang="fr">des confitures</i>, a cheese of the country,
coffee, but now? "Regardez, Mademoiselle. Ah que
c'est triste. Il n'y a rien du tout, du tout, du tout."
And indeed there was nothing but a mound of material
that might have been mistaken for road rubbish.</p>

<p>Eventually she found a stone bench in the yard,
and there we munched our sandwiches while she
flitted away, to come back presently with bunches of
green grapes, sweet enough but very small. The vine
had not been tended for a year, it was running wild.
They were not what <i lang="fr">ces dames</i> should be given, but if
we would accept them? We would have taken prussic
acid from her just then, I believe, but fortunately it
did not occur to her to offer it. She cut us dahlias
from her ragged garden (once loved and carefully
tended), and hearing that one of us was a connoisseur
in shell-cases, bits of old iron and other gruesome relics,
rooted about until she found another shell-case, with
which upon our backs we staggered over to Laimont.</p>

<p>And now let me hereby solemnly declare that if
any one ever dares to tell me that the French are
inhospitable I will smite him with a great and deadly
smiting. I am not trying to suggest that they clasped
us in their arms and showered riches upon us within
an hour of our meeting. They showed a measure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
sanity and caution in all their ways. They waited
to see what manner of men we were before they flung
wide their doors, but once the doors were wide the
measure of their generosity was only limited by the
extent of our need.</p>

<p>Was it advice, an introduction to an influential
person, a string pulled here, a barrier broken down
there, Madame B. and Madame D. were always at our
service. Gifts of fruit and flowers came constantly
to our door, our <i lang="fr">bidons</i> were miraculously filled with
paraffin in a famine which we, being foolish virgins, had
not foreseen, or, foreseeing, had not guarded against,
and once in the heavy frost, when wood was unobtainable
in the town and the supply ordered from Sermaize
was over-long in coming, our lives were saved by a bag
of oak blocks which scented the house, and <i lang="fr">boulets</i>
that made the stove glow with magnificent ardour.
In every difficulty we turned to Madame B. She
helped us out of many an <i lang="fr">impasse</i>, and whether we
asked her to buy dolls in Paris or, by persuading a
General and his Staff that without our timely aid
France could never win the war, to reconcile an Army
Corps to our erratic activities in its midst, she never
failed us. When two of our party planned a week-end
shopping expedition to Nancy, it was Madame B. who
discovered that the inhabitants of that much-harassed
town were leading frozen lives in their cellars, and if
she was sometimes electrifyingly candid in her criticism,
she was equally unstinted in her praise. Madame D.,
with her old-world courtesy, was no less hospitable, and
many a frantic S.O.S. brought her at top speed to our
door.</p>

<p>From Monsieur C., who used to assure us that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
dispensed our gifts with a <i lang="fr">délicatesse</i> that was <i lang="fr">parfait</i>,
and Madame K. showering baskets of luscious raspberries,
to the poorest refugee who begged us to drink
a glass of wine with her, or who deeply regretted her
inability to make some little return for the help we
had given her, they outvied one another in refuting
the age-old libel on the character of the French.</p>

<p>"But," cries some acidulated critic, "you would
have us believe that the poilu is a blue-winged angel,
and the civilian too perfect to live." Far from it.
The poilu is only a man, the civilian only human, and
I have yet to learn that either&mdash;be he man or human&mdash;is
perfect any more than he, or his equivalent is perfect
even in this perfect English island in the sea. There
are soldiers who.... There are civilians who....</p>

<p>I guess the devil doesn't inject original sin into them
with a two-pronged hypodermic syringe any more than
he injects it into us. The good and the evil sprout
up together, or are they the spiritual Siamese twin
that is born of every one of us to be a perpetual confusion
to our minds, a bewilderment to our bodies
and a most difficult progeny to rear at the best of
times? For as surely as you encourage one of the
twins the other sets up a roar, sometimes they howl
together, sometimes one stuffs his fist down the other's
throat. And the bad one is hard to kill, and the good
one has a tendency to rickets. No wonder it is a
funny muddle of a world.</p>

<p>And the French have their twin too, only theirs
say <i lang="fr">la-la</i> and ours say damn, and if they keep an over-sharp
eye on the sous, do we turn our noses up at excess
profits?</p>

<p>Of course some of them are greedy, perhaps greedier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
on the whole than we are. Would any English village
lock its wells when thirsty children wailed at its door?
I know an Irish one would not. But the French are
thrifty, and the majority of them would live comfortably
on what a British family wastes. They work
hard too. They are incredibly industrious, perhaps
because they have to be.</p>

<p>France has not yet been inoculated with the virus
of philanthropy, an escape on which she may possibly
be congratulated. The country is not covered with a
network of charitable societies overlapping and criss-crossing
like railway lines at a junction, nor have
French women of birth, independent means and superfluous
energy our genius for managing other people's
affairs so well there is no time to look after our own.
The deserving poor run no risk of being pauperised,
the undeserving don't keep secretaries, committees and
tribes of enthusiastic females labouring heavily at their
heels. The French family in difficulties has to depend
on its own resources, its own wit, its own initiative
and energy, and when I think of the way our refugees
dug themselves in in Bar-le-Duc, and scratched and
scraped, and hammered and battered at that inhospitable
soil till they forced a living from its breast, my
faith in philanthropy and the helping hand begins to
wane.</p>

<p>Of course there are hard cases, where a little intelligent
human sympathy would transform suffering
and sorrow into contentment and joy, cases that send
me flying remorsefully back to the altar of organised
charity with an offering in outstretched hand, but
above all these, over all the agony of war the stern
independence of French character has ridden supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>So let their faults speak for themselves. Who am
I that I should expose them to a pitiless world? Have
I not faults of my own? See how I have kept poor
Madame Pierrot gathering dahlias in her garden, and
my comrade in adventure eating grapes upon a very
stony seat. So long that now there is no time to tell
you how we walked to Laimont and investigated more
ruins there, and then how we walked to Mussey where
we comfortably missed our train, and how a Good
Samaritan directed us to a house, and how in the
house we found a little old lady whose son had been
missing since August 1914, and who pathetically
wondered whether we could get news of him, and how
a <i lang="fr">sauf-conduit</i> had to be coaxed from the Mayor, and
the little old lady's horse harnessed to a car, and how
two chairs were planted in the car and we superficially
planted on the chairs, and how the old lady and a
brigand clambered on to the board in front, and how
we drove down to Bar as the sun was setting. Nor
can I tell you how nearly we were run into by a motor-car,
nor how the old lady explained that the brigand
was <i lang="fr">malheureusement</i> nearly blind, and that she, still
more <i lang="fr">malheureusement</i>, was rather deaf, nor how we
prayed as we clung desperately to the chairs which
slid and wobbled and rocked and oscillated, and rattled
our bones while all the military motor-cars in France
sought our extermination.</p>

<p>Nor can I tell you how at a dangerous crossing the
brigand drew up his steed, and set up a wail because
he had forgotten his cigarettes, nor how one escapading
female produced State Express which made him
splutter and cough, and nearly wreck us in the ditch
(though English tobacco is not nearly so strong as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
French), nor how we came at last to Bar-le-Duc, nor
how the old lady demanded a ridiculously small fee
for the journey, nor how I lost a glove, and the sentries
eyed us with suspicion, and the brigand who was blind
and <i lang="fr">la patronne</i> who was deaf drove away in the fading
light to Mussey, the aroma of State Express trailing
out behind them, and the old horse plodding wearily
in the dust.</p>

<p class="center">THE MODERN CALVARY</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>One day, not long after our visit to the battlefield,
our composure was riven to its very foundations by
an invitation to play croquet in the garden of Madame
G. Could we spare an hour from our so arduous toil?
For her it would be a pleasure so great, the English
they love "le sport," they play all the games, we
would show her the English way. Monsieur her
husband he adored croquet, but never, never could he
find any one to play with him. Madame, a little
swarthy woman who always dressed in rusty black,
clasped her shiny kid gloves together and gazed at us
beseechingly. The Arbiter of our destinies decided
that we must go. There is always <i lang="fr">l'Entente</i>, you
know, it should be encouraged at all hazards, a sentiment
which meets with my fullest approval when the
hazard does not happen to be mine.</p>

<p>Madame yearned that we should throw ourselves
into "le sport" at four, but the devil of malice, who
sits so persistently on my shoulder, arranged that I
should be the only one free at that hour. The others
promised to come at half-past four.</p>

<p>"But, my dear women," I cried, "I haven't played
croquet for ages."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind. Hit something, do anything. But go."</p>

<p>I went. I was ushered into a tiny and stuffy parlour,
and there for twenty interminable, brain-racking
minutes I confronted Madame G. Then an old lady
in a bath-robe sidled into the room, and we all confronted
one another for ten minutes more. Madame
G. may be a devil of a fellow with a croquet-mallet
in her hand, but small talk is not her strong point.
Neither is it mine, for the matter of that, when I am
slowly suffocating in a foreign land. However, we
finally adjourned to the garden. Where, oh where
was the croquet ground? Where, oh where were my
faithless companions? Where, oh where was tea? A
quarter to five rang out from the tower of Nôtre Dame,
and here was I marooned on a French grass plot adorned
with trees, real trees, apple trees, plum trees, an
enterprising pergola, several flower-beds and, Heaven
help me! croquet hoops&mdash;hoops that had just
happened, all anyhow, no two looking in the same
direction. In direct line of fire rose a tall birch tree.
I gazed at it in despair. A niblick, or a lofter, or a crane
might get a ball over it, but a croquet mallet?...
Circumvention was impossible. There were three
bunkers.</p>

<p>"It is like your English croquet grounds?" Madame
asked. "We play all the Sundays&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, through the Looking-glass," I murmured,
and she responded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Plaît-il?"</p>

<p>I hastily congratulated her on the condition of her
fruit trees.</p>

<p>Five o'clock. What I thought of the faithless was
by now so sulphuric, blue flames must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
leaping out of me. Five-fifteen. A Sail! The
Arbiter, full of apologies, which did nothing to soften
the steely reproval in my eye. Then Madame disappeared.
At five-thirty she came back again accompanied
by delinquent number two. She held a hurried
consultation with the bath-robe, then melted again
into the void.</p>

<p>"Can I go?" I signalled to the Arbiter. She shook
a vigorous head. The rattle of tea-cups was coming
from afar. At a quarter to six Madame announced
tea. It was served in the dining-room. We all sat
round a square table very solemnly&mdash;it was evidently
the moment of Madame's life; there was no milk, we
were expected to use rum&mdash;or was it gin?&mdash;instead.
Anyway I know it was white, and one of us tried it,
and I know ... well, politeness conquered, but she
has been a confirmed teetotaller ever since.</p>

<p>At six-five Madame was weeping as she recounted
a tale she had read in the paper a day or so before,
and six-twenty-five we came away.</p>

<p>"And we never played croquet after all. But you
will come again when Monsieur mon mari is here, for
Les Anglaises they love 'le sport.'"</p>

<p>But we never went back. Perhaps the tree-tops
frightened us, or perhaps we were becoming too much
engrossed in sport of another kind. You see, M. le Curé
of N. came to visit us the next day, and soon after that
Madame Lassanne inscribed her name on our books.
Which shall I tell you about first? Madame Lassanne,
who was a friend of Madame Drouet, and actually
succeeded in making her talk for quite a long time on
the stairs one day? I think so.</p>

<p>Perhaps to-morrow I shall tell you of M. Le Curé.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>You see, it was really Madame Lassanne who first
brought home to me what war means to the civil
population in an invaded district. One guessed it all
in a dim way before, of course, every imaginative
person does, but not in the way in which pain, desolation
of spirit, agony of soul, poignant anxiety drive
their roots deep down into Life; nor does one realise
how small a thing is human life, how negligible man
when compared with the great god of War.</p>

<p>A French medical officer once said to me,
"Mademoiselle, in war les civiles n'ont pas le droit
d'être malade," and I dared to reply, "Monsieur, ils
n'ont guère le droit de vivre." And he assented, for
he knew, knew that to a great extent it was true, only
too pitiably true. For the great military machine
which exists in order that an unshakable bulwark may
be set up between the invader and the civilians whom he
would crush is, in its turn, and in order to keep that
bulwark firm, obliged to crush them himself. In the
War Zone (it is not too much to say it) the civilian is
an incubus, an impediment, a most infernal nuisance.
He gets so confoundedly in the way. And he is swept
out of it as ruthlessly as a hospital matron sweeps
dust out of her wards. That he is confused and bewildered,
thoroughly <i lang="fr">désorienté</i>, that he may be sick or
feeble, that his wife may be about to give birth to a
child, that his house is in ashes and that he, once
prosperous, is now a destitute pauper, that his children
trail pitifully in the dust, footsore, frightened, terror-haunted
to the very verge of insanity, all these things
from the military point of view matter nothing. And
it must be so. They dare not matter. If they did,
energies devoted to keeping that human bulwark in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the trenches fit and sound might be diverted into other
channels, and the effort to ameliorate and save become
the hand of destruction, ruining all in order to save a
little.</p>

<p>Think of one village. There are thousands, and any
one will do. Anxiety and apprehension have lain
over it for days, but the inhabitants go about their
work, eat, sleep, "carry on" much as usual. Night
comes. It is pitch dark. The world is swathed in a
murky shroud. At two o'clock loud hammering is
heard, the gendarmes are going from house to house
beating upon the doors. "Get up, get up; in half
an hour you must be gone." Dazed with sleep, riven
with fear, grief slowly closing her icy fingers upon their
hearts, they stumble from their beds and throw on a
few clothes. They look round the rooms filled with
things nearly every one of which has a history, things
of no intrinsic value, but endeared to them by long
association, and it may be by memory of days when
Love and Youth went hand in hand to the Gates of
Romance and they opened wide at their touch. Things,
too, that no money can buy: old <i lang="fr">armoires</i> wonderfully
carved, old china, old pottery, handed down from
father to son, from mother to child for generations.</p>

<p>What would one choose in such a moment as
that?</p>

<p>"You can take nothing but what you can carry."
Nothing. The children clutch at hand and skirt.
How can Marie and Germaine and Jean and Robert
walk fifteen or twenty kilomètres to safety?</p>

<p>The prudent snatch at their family papers, thrust a
little food into a bag and go out into the night. Others
gather up useless rubbish because it lies under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
hand. The gendarmes are growing impatient. They
round up their human flock as a dog rounds up his
sheep. Shells are beginning to fall here and there.
Some one has been killed&mdash;a child. Then a woman.
There are cries, a long moan of pain. But the refugees
must hurry on.</p>

<p>"Vîte, vîte, depêchez-vous." They stumble down
the roads, going they know not whither, following the
lanes, the woods, even the fields, for the main road must
be kept clear for the army. Hunger, thirst, the torment
of an August day must be endured, exhaustion
must be combated. Death hovers over them. He
stoops and touches now one, now another with his
wings, and quietly they slip down upon the parched
and baking earth, for they are old and weary, and rest
is sweet after the long burden of the day.</p>

<p>But even this is not all. One may believe that at
first, engulfed by the instinct of self-preservation,
tossed by the whirlwind from one emotion to another
and into the lowest pit of physical pain, the mind is too
confused, too stunned to realise the full significance
of all that is happening.</p>

<p>But once in their new quarters, with the long days
stretching out ahead and the dark night behind, in
wretchedness, in bitter poverty, ah! then Thoughts,
Memories, Regrets and Infinite Lonelinesses throng
upon them, and little by little realisation comes and
at last they <span class="smcap">KNOW</span>.</p>

<p>Know that the broken threads of life can never be
taken up again in the old good way. "On était si
heureux là-bas."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> How often I have heard that said!
"On vivait tout doucement. On n'était pas riche, ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
fois, but <i lang="fr">we had enough</i>!" Poignant words those, in
Refugee-land.</p>

<p>Added to the haunting dread of the future there is
always the ghost-filled dream of the past. Women
who have spoken with steady composure of the loss of
thousands of francs, of the ruin of businesses built up
through years of patient industry and hard work, of
farms&mdash;rich, productive, well-stocked&mdash;- laid waste and
bare, have broken down and sobbed pitifully when
speaking of some trivial intrinsically-valueless possession.
How our hearts twine themselves round these
ridiculous little things, what colour, what meaning they
lend to life!</p>

<p>To lose them, ah, yes! that is bad enough; but
to know that hands stained with blood will snatch at
them and turn them over, and that eyes still bestial
with lust will appraise their value.... That is where
the sharpest sting lies. The man or woman whose
house is effaced by a shell is happy indeed compared
with those who have seen the Germans come, who have
watched the pillage and the looting and the sacrilege
of all they hold most dear.</p>

<p>But the <i lang="fr">émigré's</i> cup must hold even greater sorrows
and anxieties than these. "C'est un vrai Calvaire que
nous souffrons, Mademoiselle." So they will tell you,
and it is heartbreakingly true. Crucified upon the iron
cross of German ambition, they pray daily that the cup
may be taken from them, but the mocking god of
War still holds it to their lips. They must drink it
even to the very dregs.</p>

<p>For not always could all the members of a family
get away together. It has been the fate of many to
remain behind, to become prisoners in the shadowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
land behind the trenches, at the mercy of a merciless
foe. Between them and their relatives in uninvaded
France no direct communication can be established.
An impenetrable shutter is drawn down between.
Only at rare intervals news can come, and that is when
a soldier son or father or other near relative becomes a
prisoner of war in Germany. A French woman in the
<i lang="fr">pays envahi</i> may write to a prisoner in Germany, and
he to her. He may also write to his friends in the free
world beyond. And so it sometimes happens that
news trickles through, but very rarely. The risk
is tremendous, detection heavily punished. Only
oblique reference can be indulged in, and when one has
heard nothing for months, perhaps years, how meagre
and unsatisfying that must be. Do we in England
realise what it means? I know I did not before I met
Madame Lassanne, and only very inadequately as I
sat in the kitchen of the Ferme du Popey and listened
to her story.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>She was the daughter of one farmer, the wife of
another and successful one, the richest in their district,
so people said. When the war broke out her husband
was mobilised, she with her three children, a girl of
four, a boy of two and a month-old baby, remaining
at the farm with her father and mother. A few days,
perhaps a week or two passed, then danger threatened.
Harnessing their horses to the big farm wagons, she
and the old man packed them with <i lang="fr">literie</i>, <i lang="fr">duvets</i>,
furniture, food, clothes, everything they could find
room for, and prepared to leave the village. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
gendarmes forbade it. I suppose the road was needed
for military purposes: heavy farm wagons might
delay the passage of the troops. Throughout the
whole of one day they waited. Still the barrier was
not withdrawn. Shells began to rain on the village;
first one house, then another caught fire.</p>

<p>"You may go." The order came at last. The
children, with their grandmother and an aunt of the
Lassannes, were placed in the wagons and the little
procession set out; but they were not destined to go
far that day. At the next village the barrier fell again.
Believing that the Germans were following close behind,
they held hasty consultation, as the result of which the
old women decided to walk on with the children,
leaving M. Breda and Madame to follow as soon as
the way was clear.</p>

<p>So the horses and wagons were put into a stable,
and Madame and her father sat down to wait. The
slow hours ticked away, a shell screamed overhead,
another, then another. Soon they were falling in
torrents on the little street. Houses began to crash
down, the stable caught fire, the four horses and the
wagons were burned to a cinder. Then the house in
which the refugees had sheltered was struck. They
escaped by a miracle, crawling on hands and knees.
So terrific was the bombardment they dared not go
down the road. A barrage of shell-fire played over
it. With some dozens of others as miserable as themselves
they lay all night in a furrow in a beet-field,
Madame trembling in her father's arms, for shells were
falling incessantly on the field and all around them.
At dawn the hurricane ceased, and they crept away.
The road was open now, they were on foot. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
walked fast, then faster, hoping every minute to overtake
the children. The old women surely could not
have gone very far. But mile after mile was conquered
and no news of them could be found. No
sentries had seen them, no gendarme had watched
them go by. They asked every one they met on the
road, at first hopefully, then, as fear grew, with clutching
hands and fevered eyes. But the answer was
always the same. They had not passed that way.
Chance, Fate, call it what you will, brought Madame
and the old man to Bar-le-Duc, and there, soon after
her arrival, she heard that her husband had been
wounded in the earliest of the fighting and was now a
prisoner in Germany. A prisoner and ill. Day after
day dragged by. She found employment on the farm
near the town, she made inquiries, exhausted every
channel of information, but no trace of the children
could be found.</p>

<p>And her husband, writing from Germany, demanded
news of them! He did not know that the farm was
demolished, and that she was beggared. He asked for
parcels, for comforts. She sent them to him, by what
supreme effort of self-denial only she and the God she
prayed to know. And she wrote him little notes, gay,
brave little notes. She told him all about the children&mdash;how
fat and how strong they were.... And Marie&mdash;ah,
Marie was growing tall&mdash;so tall.... And Roger
was able to talk now....</p>

<p>God only knows what it cost her to write those letters;
God only knows with what agony she forced her tears
back to their source lest one, falling on the paper,
betray her. She went about her work white-faced and
worn, hungering for the news that never came, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
autumn faded into winter and spring was born and
blossomed into summer, and then, and then only, did
the shutter lift and a tiny ray of light come through.</p>

<p>Confused and frightened, the old women, burdened
with the children, had lost their way in the darkness
and wandered back into the German lines. They were
now prisoners in Carignan (near the frontier); they
managed to smuggle a letter through. The baby was
dead. There was no milk to be had, so it died of
starvation. Madame Breda had been offered freedom.
If she wished she would be sent back into France
through Switzerland. But the children's names were
not on the list of those selected for repatriation.</p>

<p>"Could they go with her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Eh bien, j'y reste."</p>

<p>The shutter snapped down again, the veil enclosed
them, and Madame resigned herself to the long, weary
waiting.</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that such stories as this&mdash;and
there were all too many of them&mdash;filled us with hatred
of everything German? In those first months of
personal contact with war we were always at white
heat, consumed with rage and indignation, and for
my own part, at least, desirous of nothing less than the
extermination of kultur and every exponent of it. As
I walked home through the quiet afternoon, dark
thoughts filled my mind. What a monster one can be!
What longing for vengeance even the mildest of us can
cherish! I thought of another village not far from
that of Madame Lassanne's home, from which three
hundred people had been driven into virtual slavery.
Nearly all were old&mdash;over sixty, some few were boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and girls of fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, and of the old,
eighty died in the first six months.</p>

<p>It was a long time now since any news had come
through, and those who waited had almost given up
hope of seeing their loved ones again.</p>

<p>And we were impotent. With an effort I shook off
despondency. I would go and see Madame Leblan
and rest a while in her garden. She was lonely and
loved a little visit. It would amuse her to hear about
the Curé and our visit to N.; any gossip would serve to
drive away her memories. "Ça change les idées,"
she would say. "It is not well to sit and brood."</p>

<p>Neither is it well to walk and brood; yet here was
I, foolish virgin that I was, brooding like a moulting
hen. Taking myself firmly in hand, I turned down the
rue de L'Étoile and opened the garden gate.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>Madame was only a poor peasant woman, but she
had once been very beautiful, and the old face was
handsome still. The aquiline features are well-modelled,
the large blue eyes clear and steady, flashing
now with a fine pride, now with delicious humour; the
head is well poised, she is essentially dignified; there
are times when she has the air of a queen.</p>

<p>Her husband is tall and thin, with a drooping moustache,
and in accordance with prevailing custom he
keeps his hat on in the house, and he is seventy-two
and she is seventy, and when I saw her first she was in
her quaint little garden sitting under the shade of a
mirabelle tree with an ancient dame to whom only
Rembrandt could have done justice. Like Madame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
she was short and broad, and without being handsome,
she was just bonny. She had jolly little eyes and a
chubby, dimpled face, and wore a spotlessly white and
befrilled cap with strings that tied under her chin and
made you rather want to kiss her. She was just a
little <i lang="fr">coquette</i> in her appearance, and she must have
been born in prehistoric times, for she was "la tante de
Madame Leblan." She didn't live in the little cottage,
she had a room just across the way, and there I would
see her sitting in the sun on a fine day as I turned in
at the garden gate.</p>

<p>Of course we went down before her, and gave her of
our best, for she was an irresistible old thing, who
could coax you into cyclonic generosity. She would
come trotting over to see us with a small basket on
her arm, and having waited till the crowd that besieged
our morning hours had melted away, would come upstairs
looking so innocent and so picturesque our hearts
were as water before her. And then out of the basket
would come apples, or pears, or walnuts, with a honeyed
phrase, the little vivid eyes searching our own. Refusal
was out of the question, we were in the toils, knowing
that for Madame we were the sun in the heavens, the
down on the wings of the Angel of Life; knowing, too,
that surely as she turned away would come the tactful
hint, the murmured need. And though periodically
we swore that she should have no more, she rarely
went empty away.</p>

<p>At last, because of the equality of things, we hardened
our hearts. She returned with walnuts. Our
thanks being meticulously verbal, she retreated thoughtfully,
to reappear a few days later with three pears
and a remote <i lang="fr">malaise</i> that successfully defied diagnosis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
We knew she had her eyes on medical comforts, eggs,
<i lang="fr">bons</i> for meat, etc., so the <i lang="fr">malaise</i> deceived no one,
while a cold gift of aspirin tabloids nearly destroyed
her faith in humanity.</p>

<p>And all the time she was "rich"! No wonder she
was <i lang="fr">coquette</i>, she could afford to be, for she had small
<i lang="fr">rentes</i>, and money laid by, and had saved all her papers
and her bank-book. So Madame Leblan, who had
left home with exactly twenty-seven francs in her
pocket, told me, but not, loyally enough, until she was
sure that our gifts to La Tante had ceased.</p>

<p>She herself never asked for anything, save once,
and that was for a <i lang="fr">paletot</i> for Monsieur. In spite of
his three-score-years-and-twelve, in spite of the severe
attack of internal hæmorrhage from which he was
recovering, he went to work every morning at six,
returning at six at night. Hard manual toil it was,
too, much too hard for a man of his years. How
Madame fretted over him! How she scraped and saved
to buy him little comforts. And he did need that coat
badly. I think I shall never forget her face when she
saw the warm Cardigan jacket the Society provided
for him. Her eyes filled with tears, she flushed like a
girl, she looked radiantly beautiful and then, with the
most gracious diffidence in the world, "You will permit
me?" she said, and drew my face down to hers.</p>

<p>There was something about that old creature that
made me feel ashamed. What one did was so pitifully
little, but she made it seem like a gift of star-flowers
bathed in the dews of heaven. It was her unconquerable
sense of humour that attracted me to her, I suppose.
French wit playing over the fields of life with
an indomitable spirit that would not be broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>When she was a girl her father used to say to her,
"You sing too much, some day you will cry," but
though the tears did come she never lost her gaiety
of heart. When she married she was very poor;
Monsieur's father had been foolish, loving wine, and
they had to make their own way in the world, but she
held her head high and did her best for her boys. It
should never be said of them that they were educated
at the cow's tail (à la queue des bêtes). Her pride came
to her aid, and perhaps much of her instinctive good
breeding too. <i lang="fr">Le fils</i> in the Garde Republicaine in
Paris has much of his mother's manner.</p>

<p>Leaving the cottage was a terrible wrench. They
packed a few odds-and-ends into a bundle, and she
tidied everything, saying farewell to the little treasures
they had collected in forty-odd years. Silently they
locked the doors behind them, her eyes dry, the
catastrophe too big for tears. But in the garden
Monsieur paused. "Les bêtes," he said; "we mustn't
leave them to starve. Open the cow-house door and
let them go free." As she turned to obey him her feet
faltered, the world swam in a mist of tears. She thrust
the key blindly into his hands and stumbled like a
drunken woman down the road.</p>

<p>Then for six weeks they trudged together. They
slept in fields, in the woods, under carts, in barns,
they were drenched with rain and with dew, they were
often hungry and thirsty and cold. But they struggled
on until they came to Vavincourt, and there the owner
of the little house in Bar met them, and seeing what
manner of people they were, lent it to them rent free
on condition that they looked after the garden. How
grateful Madame was, but how intensely she longed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
for home! How wistfully she turned her eyes northward
across the hills! How often the question, When?
trembled half spoken on her lips! What mattered it
that home was a ruin and she penniless? Just to be
in the valley again, to see the sun gleaming on the
river.</p>

<p>To help the time to pass less sluggishly by we had
invented a little tale, a tale of which I was the unworthy
heroine, and the hero an unknown millionaire. The
millionaire with gold <i lang="fr">jusqu'au plafond</i>, who was obligingly
waiting for me beyond the sea, and who would
come some day and lay his heart, his hand, and his
gold-mine at my feet. And then a <i lang="fr">petit palais</i> would
spring miraculously from that much-loved rubbish-heap
at Véry, and one day as Madame and <i lang="fr">le patron</i>
stood by the door, they would see a great aeroplane
skimming through the sky, it would swoop and settle,
and from it would leap the millionaire and his blushing
bride. And Madame would lead them in and give
them wine and coffee and a salad and <i lang="fr">saucissons de
Lorraine</i>, which are better and more delicious than any
other <i lang="fr">saucissons</i> in all the wide world.</p>

<p>Only a foolish little story, but when one is old and
one's heart is weary it is good to be foolish at times,
good to spin the sun-kissed webs, good to leave the
dark chamber of despair and stray with timid feet over
the gleaming meadows of hope.</p>

<p>Her greeting rarely varied. "Je vous croyais
morte," a reproach for the supposed infrequency of
my visits. She cried it now, though scarcely a week
had sped since I saw her last, and then with mysterious
winks and nods she hobbled into the house, to return
a few minutes later with two or three bunches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
grapes and some fine pears. "Pendant la guerre tous
les scellés sont levés,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> she laughed, but I knew she
had not robbed her benefactor. The fruit she kept
<i lang="fr">en cachette</i> for us, she and M. Leblan deprived themselves
of, nor could any remonstrance on our part
stay her.</p>

<p>"Where is your basket?" She had ordered me to
bring one on my next visit, yet here was I, most perplexingly
without. But the fruit must be carried home.
She had no basket, no paper. <i lang="fr">Méchante</i> that I was,
to come without that basket. Had not she, Madame,
commanded it? In vain I refused the gift. She was
inexorable.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have it." She seized me with delighted hands,
and it was then that the uniform earned my bitterest
reproach, for into its pockets, whose size suggested
that they were originally intended to hold the guano
and rabbits of agricultural relief, went the pears.
One might as well argue with a megatherium as with
Madame when her mind was made up. So I had to
stand in the kitchen growing bulkier and bulkier, with
knobs and hillocks and boulders and tussocks sprouting
all over me, feeling like a fatted calf, and longing for
kindly darkness to swallow me up. Subsequently I
slunk home by unfrequented ways, every yard of which
seemed to be adorned with a gendarme taking notes.
I am convinced that I escaped arrest and decapitation
only by a miracle, and that every dog in the town
bayed at my heels.</p>

<p>My agonies, needless to say, met with scant sympathy
from my companions. They accused me of flirting with
M. Leblan, even while they dug greedy teeth into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
pears, an accusation it was difficult to refute when
he called at the house one evening and, hearing that I
was out, refused to leave a message, but turned up later
and demanded an interview with such an air of mystery
Madame came to call me fluttering so we thought the
President of the Republic must be at the door.</p>

<p>Still more difficult was it to refute when Monsieur
had gone away, leaving me transfixed on the stairs
with two huge bottles of mirabelle plums in my hands.
I never dared to tell the three villains who made life
such a happy thing on the Boulevard de la Rochelle
that Monsieur was wont to say that if only he were
twenty years younger he ... he.... Can you guess
what he?...</p>

<p>Madame did. She knew, and used to tease me about
it. She is one of the few people in the world who know
that I still can blush! Do you? No? Ah, but then
you have never seen Monsieur! You have never heard
him say what he ... what he ... well, you know
what he....</p>

<p>There were no dark thoughts in my mind as I sped
circuitously homewards, skimming down a by-street
every time a gendarme loomed in view; I was thinking
of Madame and of the twinkle in her eyes when she
talked of <i lang="fr">le patron</i>, and of the long day spent at N.,
the story of which had helped to drive away for the
moment the most persistent of her <i lang="fr">idées noires</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">IN WHICH WE BECOME EMISSARIES OF LE BON DIEU</p>


<p>Now the coming of M. le Curé was in this wise.</p>

<p>We were making up <i lang="fr">paquets</i> in the Clothes-room, we
were grimy, dishevelled and hot, we were in no mood
for visitors, we were pining for tea, and yet Madame
insinuated her head round the door and announced,
"M. le Curé de N." She would have announced
the Czar of Russia, or President Wilson, or General
Joffre, or the dustman in exactly the same emotionless
tones, and with as little consideration for our feelings.</p>

<p>"You go."</p>

<p>"No. You."</p>

<p>The tug of war ended, as such tugs generally do, in
our going together, smoothing hair that flew on end,
flinging overalls into a corner and praying hastily that
the Curé might be an unobservant man. He was.
There was only one vision in the world for him; the
air, the atmosphere, life itself were but mirrors reflecting
it; but conceding that it was a large one, we found some
excuse for his egoism. Large? Massive. He was
some inches over six feet in height and his soutane
described a wide arc in advance. His hands were thick
and cushiony, you felt yours sink into their pneumatic
fastnesses as you greeted him; he had a huge head,
very little hair, a long heavy jowl, small eyes, and
he breathed fatly, thickly. His voice was slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
smothered. Many years ago he had retired from his
ministry, living at N. because he owned property there,
but the war, which called all priests of military age and
fitness to the colours, drew him from his life of ease
and put the two villages, N. and R., under his spiritual
charge. His gestures were large and commanding,
he exuded benevolence&mdash;the benevolence of a despot.
There would be no divided authority in the Curé's
kingdom. It was not a matter for surprise to hear
that he was not on speaking terms with his mayor,
it would have been a matter for surprise if, had he been
Pope, he had ever relinquished his temporal power.</p>

<p>He wasted little time on the usual preliminaries,
plunging directly into his subject. At N. and R.
there were refugees, <i lang="fr">pauvres victimes de la guerre dans
la grande misère</i>, sleeping on straw <i lang="fr">comme des bêtes</i>, cold,
half-clothed, in need of every necessary. He had
heard of us, of our generosity (he called us "mes
bonnes dames," with just a hint of condescension in
his manner), he wished us to visit his people. Wished?
He commanded. He implied, by an art I had not
thought him capable of, that we were yearning to visit
them, that our days would be storm-tossed, our nights
sleepless unless we brought them relief. From mendicant,
he transformed himself into benefactor, bestowing
on us an opportunity which&mdash;it is due to our reputation
to suggest&mdash;we craved.</p>

<p>It was well that our inclination jumped with his
desire, for he was quite capable of picking us up, one
under each arm, and marching off with us to N., had
we refused. But how refuse in face of such splendid
faith in our goodwill, and under a shower of compliments
that set us blushing to the tips of our toes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
We punctuated the flood or shower with murmurs of,
"C'est un plaisir," or, "On ne demande pas mieux."
We felt like lumbering elephants as we tried to turn
aside his flattery, but he merely waved a benediction
and swept on. We would go to N. next Wednesday;
he, Monsieur, would meet us, and conduct us personally
over the village. He would tell us who were the good
Catholics&mdash;not that he wished to deprive the careless or
sinful of our help; still, it would be as well for us to
know. We read "preferential treatment" on this
sign-post, and carefully reserved our opinion. When
the visits were over, we would go to his house and eat
an <i lang="fr">œuf à la coque</i> with him, and some <i lang="fr">confitures</i>. His
modest establishment ... a gesture indicated an
ascetic régime, the bare necessities of life, but if we
would accept?...</p>

<p>"With pleasure, if Monsieur was sure it would not
inconvenience him."</p>

<p>"Mes bonnes dames," he replied grandly, "rien ne
me dérange dans le service du bon Dieu."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Of course it rained on Wednesday&mdash;rained quietly,
hopelessly, despairingly, but persistently. Nevertheless
we set out, chiefly&mdash;so great was Monsieur's faith
in us&mdash;because it did not seem possible to remain at
home. We put on the oilskins which, with the uniform,
we had been led to understand would save our lives in
France, but the sou'westers we did not wear. There
are limits. And when later on we saw a worker clad
in both, we did not know which to admire most,
the courage which enabled her to wear them, or the
utter lack of imagination which prevented her from
realising their devastating effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>So we left the sou'westers on the pegs from which
they were never taken, and arrived at N. in black shiny
oilskins that stood out stiffly like boards from our
figures, and were almost as comfortable to wear. We
were splashed with mud, and we dripped audibly on
the Curé's beautiful parquet floor.</p>

<p>We wished to begin at once? <i lang="fr">Bon. Allons.</i> He,
the Curé, had prepared a list, the name of every refugee
was inscribed on it. Oh, yes, he understood <i lang="fr">parfaitement</i>,
that to make <i lang="fr">paquets</i> we must know the age and
sex of every individual. All was prepared. We would
see how perfect the arrangements were.</p>

<p>No doubt from his point of view they were perfect,
but from ours chaotic. We climbed the village street,
he like a frigate in full sail, his wide cloak gathered
about him, leading the way, we like two rather disreputable
punts towing along behind. You know what
happened at the first house&mdash;that illuminating episode
of the <i lang="fr">seau hygiénique</i>? Worse, oh, much worse was to
befall us later! He discussed the possibilities of family
crockery with a bluntness that was conducive to
apoplexy, he left nothing to the imagination; perhaps
he thought the Britishers had no imagination.</p>

<p>In fact, his methods were sheerly cyclonic. Never
had we visited in such a whirl. Carried along in his
wake, we were tossed like small boats upon a wind-tormented
sea; we had no time to make notes, we had
no time to ask questions, and when we had finished we
had scarcely one clear idea in our minds as to the state,
social position, profession, income, or need of those we
had visited. Not a personal note (we who made copious
personal notes), not a detail (we who had a passion for
detail), only a blurred memory of general misery, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
rooms behind cow-houses and stables, through the
filthy, manure-soddened straw of which we had to pick
our way, or rooms without glass in the window-frames,
of dark, noisome holes where human beings herded, of
sacks of straw laid on the floor, of rags for bedding,
of human misery in its acutest, most wretched form.
The Curé talked of evil landlords who exploited these
unfortunate people, "Mais Dieu les punira," he added
unctuously. We wondered if the prophecy brought
consolation to the refugees. And above all the welter
of swiftly-changing impressions, I can see even now, in
a dark room lighted only by or through the chimney-shaft,
a room filled with smoke that choked and blinded
us, a small child, perhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty-four
months old, who doubled her fists into her eyes and laid
her head on her grandmother's shoulder, refusing to
look up.</p>

<p>"She has been like that since the bombardment,"
her mother explained.</p>

<p>When the priest raised the little head the child wailed,
a long, thin, almost inhuman wail; when her grandmother
put her down she lay on the floor, her eyes
crushed against her fists.</p>

<p>"She will not look at the light, nor open her eyes."</p>

<p>"How long has she been like this, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Since we left home. The village was shelled; it
frightened her."</p>

<p>"We will ask our <i lang="fr">infirmière</i> to look after her," we
promised, knowing that the nurse in question had
successfully treated a boy in Sermaize who had been
unable to open his eyes since the bombardment of the
town. And some weeks later we heard that the baby
was better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Into every house the Curé made his way, much as
Justice Shallow might have done. In every house he
reeled off a set piece about the good English who had
come to succour France in her distress, about our
devotion, our courage, our wealth, our generosity.
He asked every woman what she needed. "Trois
couvertures? Bon. Mettons trois. Un seau? Bon,
mettons un seau. Sheets? Put down two pairs."</p>

<p>We put down everything except what we most desired
to know, the names and ages of the half-clothed children&mdash;that
he gave us no opportunity of doing, was there
not always the list?&mdash;we saw the Society being steered
rapidly towards bankruptcy, but, mesmerised by his
twinkling eyes, we promised all he required. Then he,
who had been sitting on the only chair, would rise up,
and having told the pleased but bewildered lady of the
house that we were emissaries of Le bon Dieu, would
stalk out, leaving us to wonder, as we followed him,
whether Madame ever asked why the good God chose
such strange-looking messengers. The oilskins were
possessed of no celestial grace&mdash;I subsequently gave
mine to a refugee.</p>

<p>Luncheon! The good Curé stopped dead in his
tracks. The <i lang="fr">œuf à la coque</i> was calling. Back we
trailed, still dripping, still muddy, even more earthly
and less celestial than before, back to the house that
had such a delicious old garden, and where fat rabbits
grew daily fatter in their cages. The table was spread
in a panelled room hung with exquisite old potteries.
Seated solemnly, the Curé trying to conceal himself
behind a vast napkin, the end of which he tucked under
his collar, to us entered the <i lang="fr">bonne</i> carrying six boiled
eggs in a bowl. Being sufficiently hungry, we each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
ate two; they were more or less liquid, so Monsieur
tilted up the egg-shell and drank his down with gulping
noises, while we laboured unsatisfyingly with a spoon.
Then came the <i lang="fr">bonne</i> with a dish of grilled rabbit (it
was delicious); we ate rabbit. Then came a large dish
of beans; we ate beans. We were sending out wireless
messages by this, but no relief ship appeared on the
horizon. The priest groaned over the smallness of
our appetites, and shovelling large masses of beans
into his mouth, explained that it is sinful to drink too
much because the effects are demoralising, depraving,
bringing ruin on others, but one may eat as much or
more than one wants or likes, as a superfluity of food
does no harm. A little physical discomfort, perhaps,
but that passes. Injury to the spirit? None.</p>

<p>Then he commented on the strides Roman Catholicism
was making in England, the most influential people
were being converted&mdash;we thought he must be apologising
to himself for his country's alliance with a people
of heretical creed, but later on I realised that this idea
is very prevalent among the priests of the district. An
old man at Behonne congratulated me on the same good
tendency. It had not occurred to him that I was of
another faith, so there was an awkward moment when I&mdash;as
in honour bound&mdash;admitted the error, but he
glided over it with characteristic politeness, and our
interview ended as amicably as it began.</p>

<p>At N. we volunteered the information that I was Irish,
which shed balm on the Curé's perturbed soul. Though
not of the right way of thinking, one of us came of a
nation that was. That, at least, was something, and a
compliment to the evangelising Irish saints of mediæval
times&mdash;had not one of them settled in the district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
teaching the people and bringing the Gospel-light into
paths shadowed by infidelity?&mdash;steered us round what
might have been an awkward corner.</p>

<p>The beans finished, there came a cheese of the
country, rich and creamy and good. We ate cheese,
but we no longer looked at each other. The cheese
finished, in came a massive cherry tart; we ate tart,
then we drank coffee, and then Monsieur, rising from
the table, opened the door, stood in the hall and
said &mdash;&mdash; No. I think I had better not tell you what
he said, nor where he waved us to. If ever you go to N.
and have a meal with him you will find out for yourself.
During lunch one of us admired his really very beautiful
plates. "You shall have one," he said, and taking
two from the wall, offered us our choice. Of course we
refused, and the relief we read in his eye as he hung them
up again in no way diminished our appreciation of his
action.</p>

<p>Then we paid more visits, and yet more, and more,
and finally, the rain having cleared, we walked home
again in a balmy evening down the wide road under the
communal fruit trees, where the woods which clothed
the hill-side were to look like wonderful tapestry later
on, when autumn had woven her mantle of russet and
red, and dull dark crimson, and sober green, and browns
of rich, light-haunted shades and flung it over the trees.
Walked home soberly, as befitted those who had dined
with a gourmand; walked home expectantly, for was
not the list, the careful, exhaustive, all-comprehensive
list of the Curé to follow on the morrow?</p>

<p>It was and it did, and with it came the following
letter which we perused with infinite delight. How,
oh, how could he say that the miry, inarticulate bipeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
who trotted dog-like at his heels did their work <i lang="fr">avec
élicatesse</i>? How, oh, how aver that we did it under
his "modest" guidance?</p>

<p>Yet he said it. Read and believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Mesdames, et excellentes dames,<br />
</p>

<p>"J'ai l'honneur de vous offrir l'hommage de
mes sentiments les plus reconnaissantes et les plus
devoués pour tout le bien que vous faites autour de
vous avec tant de délicatesse et de générosité. Je prie
Dieu de vous benir, vous et tous les membres de vos
chères families, de donner la victoire aux vaillantes
armées de l'Angleterre, de Russie, et de France et n'y
avons nous pas le droit car vous et nous nous representons
bien la civilisation, l'honneur et la vraie religion.
Je vous envoie ci-joint la liste (bien mal faite) des
pauvres émigrés que vous avez visités sous ma modeste
direction. Il en est qui manque de linge et pour les
vieux qui out besoin de vêtements on pourra leur donner
l'étoffe, ils se changeraient de la confection ce qui je
crois serait meilleur.</p>

<p>"Veuillez me croire votre tout devoué."</p></blockquote>

<p>The list was by no means all comprehensive, it was
not careful, it was indeed <i lang="fr">bien mal faite</i>, and it exhausted
nothing but our patience. Our own demented notes
were the best we had to work upon, and so it befell
that one day some soldiers drove a vast wagon to our
door and in it we piled, not the neat <i lang="fr">paquets</i> of our
dreams, but blankets, sheets, men's clothes, women's
clothes, children's clothes, <i lang="fr">seaux</i> and other needful
things and sent them off to N., where they were dumped
in a room, and where an hour or two later, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
conditions that would have appalled the stoutest, we
fitted garments on some three hundred people, while
M. le Curé smiled wide approval and presented every
<i lang="fr">émigré</i> child in the village with a cap, a bonnet or a hat
filched from our scanty store.</p>

<p>And then because the sun was shining and several
batteries of <i lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i> were <i lang="fr">en repos</i> in the
village, we went off to inspect them. The guns were
well hidden from questing Taubes under orchard trees,
the men were washing at the fountain, or eating a
savoury stew round the camp kitchen, or flirting
desperately with the women. They showed us how to
load and how to train a gun, and then the priest, whom
they evidently liked, for he had a kindly "Hé, mon
brave, ça va bien?" or an affectionate fat-finger-tap
on the shoulder for them all, bore us off to visit an
artillery officer who had been doing wonderful things
with a <i lang="fr">crapouillot</i>. We found him in a beautiful garden
in which, on a small patch of grass, squatted the
<i lang="fr">crapouillot</i>, a torpedo fired from a frame fixed in the
ground. Alluding to some special bomb under discussion,
the lieutenant said, "It isn't much, but this&mdash;oh,
this has killed a lot of Boches."</p>

<p>He helped to perfect it, so he knew. We left him
gazing affectionately at it, a fine specimen of French
manhood, tall and slender, but strongly made, with
clear humorous eyes, and breeding in every line of him.</p>

<p>I often wonder whether he and his <i lang="fr">crapouillot</i> are
still killing "lots of Boches," and whether he ever
exclaims as did a woman who saw them breaking over
the frontier in 1914, "What a people! They are
like ants: the more of them you kill, the more there
are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>We would have liked to linger in the sunny flower-encrusted
garden, but R. awaited us. There with
consummate skill we evaded M. le Curé, and did our
visiting under no guidance but our own. A quaint little
village is R., deep enbosomed in swelling uplands, with
woods all about it, but, like N., stricken by neglect and
poverty. The inhabitants of both seemed rough and
somewhat degraded, a much lower type than the
majority of our refugees, but perhaps they were only
poor and discouraged. The war has set so many strange
seals upon us, we may no longer judge by the old standards,
no longer draw conclusions with the light, careless
assumption of infallibility of old.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">PRIESTS AND PEOPLE</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Having tasted the delights of a mild vagabondage,
we now turned our thoughts to other villages, modestly
supposing that by degrees we could "do" the Meuse.
(Had we but known it the whole of France lay before
us, refugees everywhere, and every refugee in need).
Having requisitioned a motor-car we planned tours,
but first we investigated Behonne on foot. It lies
on the hill above the aviation ground, so let no man
ask why it came first in our affections.</p>

<p>I suppose it would be impolitic to say how many
sheds there were, or how many aeroplanes we used
to see squatting like great winged beetles on the ground,
and then rising so lightly, so delicately, spiralling
higher and higher, and then darting away with swift
wing far into the shimmering blue.</p>

<p>Although Behonne is at the top of a hill, it has
managed to tuck itself into a hollow&mdash;so many French
villages have this burrowing tendency&mdash;and all you
can see of it as you approach is the top of the church
spire rising like a funny candle-extinguisher above the
ridge of the hill. The village itself is dull and uninteresting,
but the surrounding country beautiful
beyond measure, especially when the corn is ripening
in the sun; the refugees for the most part not necessitous,
having driven from home in their farm carts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
magnificently throned on feather beds and <i lang="fr">duvets</i>, with
other household goods.</p>

<p>Two houses, however, made a lasting impression. In
one, in a room in the centre of which was a well (boarded
over of course), lived a woman, her two children,
and an old man in no way related to them. The walls
were rotting, in many places straw had been stuffed
in to fill fissures and holes, the ceiling was broken,
enterprising chunks of it making occasional excursions
to the floor below, and one window was "glazed"
with paper. The doors, through which rats gnawed
an occasional way, were ill-fitting; in bad weather the
place was a funnel through which the wind whistled
and tore. The woman had one blanket and some old
clothes with which to cover herself and her children
at night, the old man had a strip of carpet given him
by the Curé, a kindly old man of peasant stock and
very narrow means. The room was exceedingly dirty,
the children looked neglected, the woman was ill.</p>

<p>In the other house was a cheery individual whose
husband had been a cripple since childhood. She told
us she had four children, the youngest being three
years old. He came running in from the street, a
great fat lusty thing, demanding to be fed, and we
learned to our astonishment that he was not yet
weaned. Eugenically interesting, this habit of nursing
children up to the age of two or even three years
of age is not uncommon, and it throws a strong light
upon the psychology of French Motherhood.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond Behonne lies Vavincourt, sacred
to the omelette of immortal memory&mdash;but oh, what a
day it was that saw us there! A fierce wind that
seemed to tear all the clothes from our bodies blew
from the north, there were some inches of snow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the ground, light powdery snow fell incessantly. We
were frozen as we drove out, we froze still harder as
we made our way from house to house, slipping and
sliding on the treacherous snow, absorbing moisture
through our boots, staggering like wooden-legged
icicles into rooms whose temperature sensibly declined
with our advent. A day of supreme physical discomfort;
a day that would surely have been our last
had not the Mayor's wife overtaken us in the street
and swept us into her kitchen, there to revive like flies
in sunshine, under the mellifluous influence of hot
coffee and omelette, <i lang="fr">confitures</i> and cheese.</p>

<p>It was in Vavincourt that we first saw women
embroidering silk gowns for the Paris shops. The
panels in pale pink were stretched on a frame (<i lang="fr">métier</i>),
at which they worked one on either side; a common
method, as we discovered during the winter. In Bar-le-Duc
we had come upon a few women who worked
without a <i lang="fr">métier</i>, but as time went on more and more
<i lang="fr">brodeuses</i> of every description came upon our books,
and so an industry was started which lived at first
more or less by taking in its own washing, but later
blossomed out into more ambitious ways. Orders
came to us from England, and a consignment of dainty
things was sent to America, but with what result I
cannot say, as I left Bar before its fate was decided.</p>

<p>The Verdun and Nancy districts appear to be the
chief centres of the <i lang="fr">broderie</i> industry, the latter being
so famous that girls are sent there to be apprenticed
to the trade, which, however, is wretchedly paid, the
rate being four sous, or rather less than twopence, an
hour, the women finding their own cotton. We gave
six sous and cotton free&mdash;gilded luxury in the workers'
eyes, though sweating in ours, and trusted to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
honesty in the matter of time, a trust which was
amply repaid, as with one or two exceptions they were
scrupulous to a degree. The most amusing delinquent
was a voluble lady from Resson who glibly replied,
"Oh, at least sixty hours, Mademoiselle," to every
question.</p>

<p>"What, sixty hours to do <span class="smcap">THAT</span>?" we would remonstrate,
looking at a small tray-cloth with a <i lang="fr">motif</i> in
each corner.</p>

<p>"Well, à peu près, one does not count exactly; but
it was long, long, vous savez." A steely eye searched
ours, read incredulity, wavered; "Six francs fifty? Eh,
mon Dieu, on acceptera bien cela." And off she would
go, to come back in faith with the same outrageous
story on the next market day. Perhaps there is excuse
for a debt of six francs swelling to eighteen when one
walks ten miles to collect it.</p>

<p>Quite a hundred women inscribed their names on
our <i lang="fr">broderie</i> wages-sheet, the war having dislocated
their connection with their old markets. The trade
itself was languishing, the workers scattered and unable
to get into touch with former employers, for Paris
shops do not deal direct as a rule, they work through
<i lang="fr">entrepreneuses</i>, or middlewomen, who now being themselves
refugees were unable to carry on their old trade.
It was almost pitiable to see how the women snatched
at an opportunity of working, only a very few, and
these chiefly <i lang="fr">métier</i> workers, being still in receipt of
orders from Paris. Some whom we found difficulty
in employing were only <i lang="fr">festonneuses</i>, earning at the best
miserable pay and doing coarse, rough work, quite
unfit for our purpose&mdash;buttonholing round the necks
and arms of cheap chemises, for instance. Others were
<i lang="fr">belles brodeuses</i>, turning out the most exquisitely dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
things, fairy garments or house-linen of the most
beautiful kind.</p>

<p>Of all ways of helping the refugees there was none
better than this. How they longed for work! The
old people would come begging for knitting or sewing.
"Ça change les idées," they would say. Anything
rather than sit day after day brooding, thinking, going
back over the tragic past, looking out upon the uncertain
future. Every franc earned was a franc in the stocking,
the <i lang="fr">bas de laine</i> whose contents were to help to
make a home for them once more when the war was
over. And what could be better than working at
one's own trade, at the thing which one loved and
which lay in one's fingers? When the needle was busy
the mind was at rest, and despair, that devourer of
endurance, slunk abashed out of sight. For they find
the time of waiting long, these refugees. Can you
wonder? Wherever we went we heard the same story;
in village or town we were asked the same question.
Each stroke of good fortune, every "push," every
fresh batch of prisoners brought the sun through the
low-hanging clouds; every reverse, the forced inactivity
of winter, drew darkness once more across the sky.
In the villages the people who owned horses were
fairly well off, they could earn their four francs a day,
but the others found little comfort. Work was scarce,
their neighbours often as poor as themselves. There
are few, if any, big country houses ruled by wealthy,
kind-hearted despots in these districts of France. In
all our wanderings we found only one village basking
in manorial smiles, and enjoying the generosity of a
"lady of the house." The needy had to fend for
themselves, and work out their own salvation as best
they might. The reception given to the Belgians in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
England read to them like a fairy tale, and fostered
wild ideas of England's wealth in their minds. "All
the English are rich," they would cry; "have we not
heard of les milords anglais?" They received accounts
of the poverty in our big cities with polite incredulity;
if our own people were starving or naked, why succour
foreigners?</p>

<p>Sometimes they smiled a little pityingly. "The
English gaspillent tout." Spendthrifts. And they
would nod sapient heads, murmuring things it is not
expedient to set down. It may even be indiscretion to
add that between the French and the Belgians no love
is set, some racial hatred having thrust its roots in deep.</p>

<p>It is in the winter that vitality and resistance-power
run lowest, especially in the villages, for though work
may be found in the fields during the summer, the long
dark winter months drag heavily by. <i lang="fr">Brodeuses</i> would
walk eight miles in and eight out again in the most
inclement weather to ask for work, others would come
as many weary miles to get a hank or two of wool with
which to knit socks and shawls. Sometimes one woman
would take back work for half a dozen, and always
our field of operations spread as village after village
was visited and the Society became known.</p>

<p>They came in their tens, they came in their hundreds,
I am tempted to swear that they came in their thousands.
Madame soon ceased to announce them, they
lined the hall, they blocked the staircase, they swirled
in the Common-room. There were days when all
the resources of the establishment failed, when <i lang="fr">broderie</i>
ran short and wool ran short, when there were no more
chemises or matinées waiting to be made up, and when
our hair, metaphorically speaking, lay in tufts over
the house, plucked from our heads by our distracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fingers. They came for work, they came for clothes,
they came for medicine and medical attendance, they
came for food&mdash;only the very poorest these&mdash;they came
for condensed milk for their babies, or for <i lang="fr">farine lactée</i>,
or for orders for admission to the Society's hospitals
at Châlons and Sermaize, or to ask us to send their
children to the <i lang="fr">Colonies des Vacances</i>, or for paper and
packing to make up parcels for husbands at the Front.
They came to buy beds and pillows and bolsters at
reduced prices and on the instalment plan, paying
so much per month according to their means; they
came for chairs and cupboards, or for the "trousseau,"
a gift&mdash;it may be reckoned as such, as they only contributed
one franc fifty towards the entire cost&mdash;of
three sheets, four pillow-cases and six towels, each of
which had to be hand-stitched or hemmed, and marked
or embroidered with the owner's name. They came
to ask for white dresses and veils&mdash;which they did
not get&mdash;for candidates for confirmation, they came
for sabots and boots, and sometimes they came for
the whole lot.</p>

<p>"Well, Madame, ça va bien?" Thus we greeted a
hardy old campaigner in the street one day.</p>

<p>"Eh bien, ça va tout doucement." Then with an
engaging smile, "I am coming to see you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Indeed? And what do you want now?" This
looks crude, but we laboured under no delusions where
Madame Morge was concerned. It was not for the
sake of our <i lang="fr">beaux yeux</i> that she visited us.</p>

<p>"Eh, ma fois, un peu de tout," she replied audaciously,
and we shot at her a mendacious, "Don't you
know that distributions have ceased?" which left her
calling heaven and her gods to witness that the earth
was crumbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Villagers who lived too far away for personal visits
wrote, or their Mayor or their priest wrote for them.
We had by this time organised our system, and knew
that the person who could supply us with a complete
and detailed list was the Mayor, or his secretary the
schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Sometimes these worthies were hard of heart, assuring
us that no one in the commune was necessitous, but
we knew from experience that the official mind is
sometimes a superficial mind, judging by externals
only, so we persisted in our demand, and were invariably
satisfied in the end. Others, and they were in a large
majority, met us with open arms, cheerfully placed
their time and their knowledge at our disposal, were
hospitable, helpful and kind, and careful to draw our
attention to specially deserving cases. Once when on
a tour of inquiry we stumbled into a village during
the luncheon hour. A regiment was resting there,
and, as the first English who presumably had set foot
in it, we were immediately surrounded by an admiring
and critical crowd, some imaginative members of which
murmured the ominous word Spy. The Mayor's house
indicated, we rapped at the door, and in response to
a gruff <i lang="fr">Entrez</i> found ourselves in a small and very
crowded kitchen, where a good <i lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i> was being
discussed at a large round table. The situation was
sufficiently embarrassing, especially as the Mayor, being
deaf, heard only a few words of our introductory speech,
and promptly wished all refugees at the devil. A list?
He was weary of lists. Every one wanted lists, the
Préfet wanted lists, the Ministre de l'Intérieur wanted
lists. And now we came and demanded them. Who
the&mdash;well, who were we that he should set his quill
a-driving on our behalf?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shout 'Anglaises' at him." It was a ticklish
moment. He was on the point of throwing us out
neck and crop. The advice was taken, the roar might
have been heard in Bar.</p>

<p>"English? You are English?"</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a raging lion suddenly transform
itself into a nice brown-eyed dog? We have, in that
little kitchen in a remote village of the Meuse. Our
hands were grasped, the Mayor was beaming. A list?
He would give us twenty lists. English? Our hands
were shaken till our fingers nearly dropped off, and if
we had eaten up all the <i lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i> Monsieur would have
deemed it an honour. However, we didn't eat it.
Monsieur's family was gazing at it with hungry eyes,
and even the best of Ententes may be strained too far.</p>

<p>When we reached the street again the crowd had
fraternised with our chauffeur, and we drove away
under a pyrotechnical display of smiles.</p>

<p>Another day a soldier suddenly sprang off the pavement,
jumped on the step of the motor-car, thrust
some freshly-roasted chestnuts into my hand and was
gone before I could cry, "Thank you."</p>

<p>We met many priests in these peripatetic adventures,
the stout, practical and pompous, the autocratic, the
negligent (there was one who regretted he could tell
us nothing: "I have only been fifteen months here, so
I don't yet know the people"), the old&mdash;I remember a
visit to a presbytery in the Aube, and finding there a
charming, gentle, diffident creature, a lover of books,
poor, spiritual, half-detached from this world, very
close to the next. He had a fine church, pure Gothic,
a joy to the eye of the connoisseur, but no congregation.
Only a wee handful of people who met each
Sunday in a side chapel, the great unfilled vault of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
church telling its own tale of changed thought and
agnostic days.</p>

<p>But most intimately of all we came to know the
Abbé B. who lived in our own town of Bar, because,
greatly daring, we rang one evening at his door and
asked him to teach us French.</p>

<p>We had heard of him from Eugénie, and knew that
he taught at the École St Louis, that he was a refugee&mdash;he
escaped from M. on his bicycle a few minutes
before the Germans entered it&mdash;and that his church
and his village were in ruins. But we had never seen
him, and when, having rung his bell, escape was no
longer possible, an awful thought shattered us. Suppose
he were fat and greasy and dull? Could any ingenuity
extract us from the situation into which we had thrust
ourselves? We felt sure it could not, so we followed
Eugénie with quaking hearts, followed her to the
garden where we found a short, dark man with a
humorous mouth and an ugly, attractive face, busily
planting peas. We nodded our satisfaction to one
another, and before we left the arrangement was made.</p>

<p>Our first lesson was devastating. The Abbé credited
us with the intelligence of children, telling us how to
make a plural, and how by adding "e" a masculine
word can be changed into a feminine; fort, forte;
grand, grande; and so on. Then he gave us a <i lang="fr">devoir</i>
(home work), and we came away feeling like naughty
children who have been put into the corner. His
parlour was stifling, and how we rejoiced when the
weather was fine, and we could hold our class in the
garden. I can see him now standing by the low wall
under the arbour, his gaze turned far away out across
the hills. "It is there," he pointed, "the village.
Out there near St Mihiel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>For twenty-seven years he had ministered there,
he had seen the children he baptised grow to manhood
and womanhood, and had gathered their children, too,
into the fold of Christ. He had beautified and adorned
the church&mdash;how he loved it!&mdash;year after year with
tireless energy and care, making it more and more
perfect, more and more fit for the service of the God
he worshipped. And now it is a ruin blown to fragments
by the guns of friend and foe alike, and his
people are scattered, many of them dead. He came
to Bar penniless, owning just the clothes he stood up
in, and he told me once that his income, including his
salary at the school and a grant from some special
fund, was just one hundred francs a month. Scarcely
a pound a week.</p>

<p>Once hearing me say that I was not rich, he asked
me the amount of my income, adding naïvely, "I
do not ask out of curiosity," and I felt mean as I
dodged the question, for an income that is "not riches"
in England looks wonderfully like wealth in a refugee's
parlour in Bar.</p>

<p>All his dream, all his desire is to go back to M. and
build his church again. The church the central, the
focussing point, then the schoolhouse, then homes for
the people, that is his plan; but he has no money, his
congregation is destitute&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;he cannot
look to the Government. Whence, then, will help
come? So he would question, filling us with intense
desire to rush back to England and plead for him and
his cause in every market square in the land. He would
go back to M. now if they would allow him to, he will go
back with or without permission when the slaughter ends.</p>

<p>"The valley is so fertile," he would say; "watered
by the Meuse, it is one of the richest in France. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
grass, such a <i lang="fr">prairie</i>. And after the war we must
cultivate, cultivate quickly; they cannot allow land
like ours to be idle, and so we shall go back at once."</p>

<p>"But," we said, "will you be able to cultivate?
Surely heavy and constant shell-fire makes the land
unfit for the plough?"</p>

<p>We knew what the ground is like all along the blood-stained
Front, hundreds of miles of it fought over
for four interminable years, its soil enriched by the
hallowed dead, torn and lacerated by shells, incalculable
tons of iron piercing its breast, and knew, too,
that Death lurks cunningly in many an unexploded
bomb or mortar or shell, and that prolonged and
costly sanitation will be necessary before man dare
live on it again. Yes, the Abbé knew it too, but knew
that a strip of his richest land lay between two hills,
the French on one, the Germans on the other, and
not a trench dug in all the length between. No wonder
hope rode gallantly in his breast, no wonder he saw
his people going quietly to their labour, and heard
his church bell ringing again its call to peaceful prayer.
And then he would revert again to the ever-present
problem, the problem of ways and means.</p>

<p>Ah, we in England do not know how that question
tortures the heart of stricken France. Shall I tell
you of it, leaving the Abbé for the moment to look out
across the hills, the reverberant thunder in his ear and
infinite longing in his loyal heart?</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>A little poem of Padraic Colum's springs to my mind
as I ask myself how to make you realise, how bring
the truth home to those who have never seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
eternal question shadow the eyes of homeless men.
One verse of it runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I am praying to God on high,<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent2">I am praying Him night and day,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">For a little home, a home of my own,<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent2">Out of the wind and the rain's way."<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and it just sums up the refugee desire.</p>

<p>You&mdash;if you are a refugee&mdash;had a home once, you
earned a livelihood; but the home is laid waste and
bare, your livelihood has vanished, and in all probability
your savings with it.</p>

<p>You buried what money you had in the cellar before
you left, because you thought you were only going
away for a few weeks, and now the Germans have
found it. You know that they pour water over cellar
floors, watching carefully to see whether any percolates
through. If it does it is clear that the earth has
recently been disturbed, so away they go for shovels
and dig; if it doesn't they try elsewhere. There is
the well, for instance. A carefully-made-up packet
might lie safely at the bottom for years, so what more
suitable as a hiding-place? What, indeed, says the
wily Hun as he is cautiously lowered into the darkness,
there to probe and pry and fish, and if he is lucky to
drag treasure from the deeps. Or you may have
hidden your all under that white rock at the end of
the garden. The rock is overturned to-day, and a
hole shows where the robber has found your gold.</p>

<p>A gnarled tree-trunk, a post, a cross-road, anything
that might serve as a mark lures him as sugar lures
the ant; he has dug and delved, and searched the
surface of France as an intensive culturist digs over
his patch of ground. He has cut down the communal
forests, the famous cherry and walnut trees of Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Éparges have all been levelled and the timber sent
into Germany; he has ripped up floors, torn out window
frames; he falls on copper and steel and iron with
shrieks of joy; he is the locust of war, with the digestion
of an ostrich; he literally "licks the platter clean,"
and what he cannot gorge he destroys.</p>

<p>So if you are a refugee you ask yourself daily, "What
shall we find when we go back? How shall we start
life afresh? Who will rebuild our houses, restock our
farms and our shops, and indemnify us for all we have
lost? France? She will have no money after the
war, and Germany will be bankrupt.</p>

<p>What can we, sheltered and safe in England, know
of such sorrow as this? To say we have never known
invasion is to say we have never known the real meaning
of war. It may and does press hardly on us, but
it does not grind us under foot. It does not set its
iron heel upon our hearts and laugh when the red
blood spurts upon the ground; it does not take our
chastity in its filthy hands and batten upon it in the
market-place; it doesn't rob us of liberty, nor of honour,
nor does it break our altars, spuming its bestialities
over the sacred flame. Our inner sanctuaries are still
holy and undefiled. Those whom we have given have
gone clear-eyed and pure-hearted to the White Temple
of Sacrifice, there to lay their gift upon the outstretched
hand of God: not one has died in shame.</p>

<p>Whatever the war may have in store for us&mdash;and
that it has much of suffering, of hardship, of privation
and bitter sorrow who can doubt?&mdash;if it spares us the
violation of our homes and of our sanctuaries, if it
leaves our frontiers unbroken, if it leaves us <span class="smcap">FREE</span>,
then, indeed, we shall have incurred a debt which it
will be difficult to pay. A debt of gratitude which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
must become a debt of honour to be paid in full measure,
pressed down, and running over to those, less fortunate
than ourselves, who will turn to us in their need.</p>

<p>And in the longed-for days to come France will need
us as she needs us now. She will need our sympathy,
our money, our very selves. She will no longer call
on us to destroy in order to save, she will call on us to
regenerate, redeem, to roll away the Stone from her
House of Death, and touching the crucified with our
hand, bid them come forth, revivified, strong and free.</p>

<p>Yes, there will be fine work to do in France when
the war is over! Constructive work, the building up
of all that has been broken down; work much of
which she will be too exhausted to undertake herself,
work of such magnitude that generations yet unborn
may not see it completed.</p>

<p>A new world to make! What possibilities that
suggests. Rolling away the Stone, watching the dead
limbs stir, the flush of health coming back into the
grey, shrivelled faces, and light springing again into
the eyes. Seeing Joy light her lamps, and Hope break
into blossom, seeing human hearts and human souls
cast off the cerecloths and come forth into the fruitful
garden. Surely we can await the end with such a
Vision Beautiful as that before us, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;it
may be that in healing the wounds of others we shall
find balm for our own.</p>

<p>The Return. If the French visualise it at all, do
they see it as a concrete thing, a long procession of
worn, exhausted, but eager men and women winding
its way from every quarter of France, from the far
Pyrenees, from the Midi, from the snow-clad Alps,
from the fertile plains, winding, with many a pitiful
gap in its ranks, back over the thorn-strewn road?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Is that their dream? Yet it may be that the reality
is only the beginning of another exile, as long, as
patient, as difficult to endure.</p>

<p>Hard-headed, practical, unimaginative reformers of
the world's woes sometimes blame the refugees who
have remained so near the Front.</p>

<p>In Bar house-rent is high, living exceedingly dear.
Legends such as "<i lang="fr">Le sucre manque</i>: <i lang="fr">Pas de tabac</i>: no
matches; no paraffin," are constantly displayed in
the shop windows, wood has more than doubled in
price, coal is simply <i lang="fr">hors de prix</i>. Milk, butter and
eggs are frequently unobtainable, and generally bad;
gas is an uncertain quantity as coal is scarce, and has a
diabolic knack of going out just when you need it
most. All of which things do not lend to the gaiety
of nations, still less to that of the <i lang="fr">allocation</i>-supported
refugee. If troops are being moved from one part of
the Front to another, the <i lang="fr">Petite Vitesse</i> ceases from its
labours and supplies are cut off from the town. Farther
south these lamentable things do not happen, but
farther south is farther from home. And there's the
rub! For home is a magnet and would draw the
refugee to the actual Front itself, there to cower in
any rude shelter did common sense and <i lang="fr">l'autorité
compétente militaire</i> not intervene.</p>

<p>So as many as possible have stayed as near the barrier
as possible. And&mdash;this is a secret, you mustn't divulge
it&mdash;these wicked, wily, homeless ones are plotting.
They are afraid that after the war the Government will
bar the road now swept by German guns; that orders
will go forth forbidding return; that railway station
<i lang="fr">guichets</i> will be barred and roads watched by lynx-eyed
policemen whom no bribe can corrupt&mdash;they will be
very special policemen, you know&mdash;no tears cajole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they plan to slip back unobserved. If one
is at the very door, not more than the proverbial hop,
skip and jump away&mdash;well, the magnet is very powerful,
and even Jove and Governments nod sometimes.
And just as the head drops forward and the eyes close,
<em>hey presto</em>! they will be over the border, and when
the barrier closes down they will be inside, and all
the gendarmes in France will not be able to put them
out again. If they can't <span class="smcap">GO</span> home, they will <span class="smcap">SNEAK</span>
home. They will get there if they have to invent an
entirely new mode of locomotion, even if they have
to live in cellars or shell-holes and eat grass&mdash;but there
may not be any grass. Didn't Sermaize live in cellars
and exist on nothing at all?&mdash;live in cellars and grow
fond of them? There is one old lady in a jolly little
wooden house to-day, who suffers from so acute a
nostalgia for her cellar she is afraid to walk past the
ruins that cover it. If she did, she declares, the beautiful
little wooden house would know her no more. The
cellar was as dark and as damp as the inside of a
whale, and it gave her a rheumatism of the devil in
all her bones, but she lived in it for three years, and
in three years one attaches oneself, <i lang="fr">ma foi</i>, one forms
<i lang="fr">des liaisons</i>. So she sits and sighs while the house-builders
meditate on the eternal irony of things, and
their pride is as a worm that daws have pecked.</p>

<p>So be sure the refugees will go back just as soon as
ever they can go, as the Abbé plans to go, caring little
if it is unwise, perhaps not realising that even if Peace
were declared to-morrow, many years must pass before
the earth can become fruitful again, many years must
set behind the hills of Time before new villages, new
towns, new cities can spring from the graves of the old.</p>

<p>Personally, I hope that some of these graves will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
left just as Germany has made them, that a few villages,
an historic town or two will be carefully guarded and
preserved, partly because ruin-loving America will
pay vast sums to see them, and so help to rebuild
others, and partly because&mdash;am I a vindictive beast?&mdash;I
want them to remain, silent, inexorable witnesses of
the true inwardness of the German method and the
German soul, if anything so degraded as she is can be
said to have a soul. "Lest we forget," these ghosts
of towns should haunt us for ever, stirring the memory
and quickening the imagination, a reproach to conscience,
an incorruptible judge of blood-guiltiness,
which we should neither pardon nor forget till the
fullest reparation has been made, the utmost contrition
has been shown. And it must be no lip-service
either. By its deeds we must know it. I want to see
Germany humbled to the very dust; I want to see
Germany in sackcloth and ashes rebuilding what she
has destroyed, sending new legions into France, but
armed this time with shovel and with pick, with brick
and with mortar; I want to see those legions labouring
to efface the imprints of the old; I want to see Germany
feeding them and paying them&mdash;they must not cost
France one sou; I want to see her in the white shroud
of the penitent, candle in hand, barefoot and bareheaded
before the Tribunal of the World, confessing
her sins, and expiating them every one in an agony
not one whit less poignant than that which she has
inflicted upon others. Yes, let the destroyer turn
builder. And until she does so let us ostracise her, cut
her out of our Book of Life. Who are we that we should
associate with the Judas who has betrayed civilisation?</p>

<p>A refugee rarely spoke of the Germans without prefixing
the adjective dirty&mdash;<i lang="fr">ces sales Boches</i>&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Abbé was no exception to the rule; indeed, he was
plain-spoken to bluntness on most occasions. His
criticisms of our French compositions would have
withered the vanity of a Narcissus, and proved altogether
too much for one timid soul, who, having endured
a martyrdom through two lessons, stubbornly refused
to go back any more. Which was regrettable, as on
closer acquaintance he proved to be rather a lovable
person, with a simplicity of soul that was as rare as
it was childlike.</p>

<p>Like the Curé of N., he presumed us Roman Catholic,
asked us if England were not rapidly coming into the
light, and commented upon the "conversion" of
Queen Victoria shortly before her death. Though it
shook him, I think he never quite believed our denial
of this remarkable story, and have sometimes reproached
myself for having deprived him of the
obvious comfort it brought him; but he took it all
in good part, and subsequently showed us that he
could be broad-minded, and tolerant as well.</p>

<p>"Charity knows no creed," he cried, and it was
impossible to avoid contrasting his implicit faith in
our honesty, his steady confidence that we would
never use our exceptional opportunities for winning
the confidence and even the affection of the people
for any illegitimate purpose, with the deep distrust
of the average Irish priest. The hag-ridden fear of
Proselytism which clouds every Irish sky dares not
show its evil face in France, nor did we ever find even
a breath of intolerance tainting our relations with
priests or with people.</p>

<p>But then perhaps they, like the Abbé, realise that
our error of faith is a misfortune rather than a fault.
Having been born that way, we were not wholly respon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>sible.
Indeed the Abbé went so far as to assure me
that I was not responsible at all.</p>

<p>"Then who is, M. l'Abbé?" I questioned, reading
condemnation of some one in his eye.</p>

<p>"Henry the Eighth," he replied, with exquisite conviction,
and I gasped. Henry the Eighth!</p>

<p>"Assurement." Had he not a quarrel with his
Holiness the Pope, and being greedy for temporal
power renounced Catholicism in a fit of rage, and so
flung the English people into the profundities of
spiritual darkness? We&mdash;we other Protestants&mdash;are his
victims; our error of faith is one for which we shall
neither be judged nor punished, but he ... I realised
that Henry deserved all my sympathy; he is not
having too good a time of it <i lang="fr">là bas</i>. Of course it was
comforting to know that we were blameless, but
privately I thought it was rather unfair to poor old
Hal, who surely has enough sins of his own to expiate
without having those of an obscure bog-trotting
Irishwoman foisted upon him as well.</p>

<p>"Yours," went on the Abbé, "is natural religion,
the heritage of your parents; ours is revealed. Some
day I will explain it to you, not&mdash;this very naïvely&mdash;with
any desire to convert you, but in order to help
you to understand why truth is to be found only in
the arms of the Roman Church."</p>

<p>It puzzled him a little that we should be Protestant,
it was so austere, so comfortless, so cold. "La scène-froide"
was the expression he used in describing our
services, "les mystères" when talking of his own. He
denounced as the grossest superstition the pathetic
belief of many an Irish peasant in the infallibility, the
almost-divine power of the priesthood, and, unlike his
colleagues in that tormented land, he is an advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of education even on the broadest basis. "Let people
think for themselves; if you keep too tight a rein they
will only revolt."</p>

<p>That he detests the present form of Government
goes without saying, his condemnation being so sweeping
the big pine tree in the garden positively trembled
before the winds of his rage. "Anything but this,"
he cried, "even a monarchy, même un Protestant,
même le Roi Albert. Atheists, self-seekers all, they
are ruining France," and then he repeated the oft-heard
conviction that the war has been sent as a
punishment for agnosticism and unbelief.</p>

<p>For Prefêts and Sous-Prefêts he entertains the profoundest
contempt, even going as far as to designate
one of the former, whom I heroically refuse to name,
a <i lang="fr">gros, gras paresseux</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the Sous-Prefêts the
<i lang="fr">âmes damnées</i> of the Minister of the Interieur. How
he hates the whole breed of them! And how joyfully
he would depose them every one! The feud between
Church and State has ploughed deep furrows in his
soul, and I gather that brotherly love did not continue
long&mdash;supposing that it ever existed&mdash;in M. when its
waves swept the village into rival factions. The
Mayor, needless to say, was agnostic, and loyal to his
Government; the Abbé furious, but trying hard to be
impartial, to eschew politics, and serve his God. He
might have succeeded had not the spirit of mischief
that lurks in his eye betrayed him and dragged him
from his precarious fence. He plunged into the controversy,
but&mdash;oh, M. l'Abbé! M. l'Abbé!&mdash;in patois
and in the columns of the local Press. Now his knowledge
of patois, gathered as a boy, had been carefully
hidden under a bushel, and so the authorship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
fierce, sarcastic, ironical letters was never known, nor
did M. le Maire ever guess why the priest's eyes
twinkled so wickedly when he passed him in the street.</p>

<p>They twinkled as he told the story, thoroughly
enjoying his little ruse, but grew fierce again when he
talked of Freemasons. To say that he thinks Freemasonry
an incarnation of the devil is to put his feelings
mildly. They are, he declares, the enemy of all virtue,
purity and truth; criminal atheists, hotbeds of everything
evil, their "tendency" resolutely set against
good. They are insidious, corrupt; defilers of public
morals and public taste.</p>

<p>"But, M. l'Abbé," I cried, "that is not so. In
England&mdash;&mdash;" I gave him a few facts. It shook him
somewhat to hear that the late King Edward, whom
he profoundly admires, was a Mason, but he recovered
himself quickly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps in England they may seem good, there
may even be good people among them, poor dupes
who do not see below the surface. <span class="smcap">There</span> all is corruption,
the goodness is only a mask worn to deceive
the ignorant and the credulous. Ah, the evil they have
wrought in the world! It was they who brought
about the war (its Divine origin was for the moment
forgotten), they were undermining Europe, they would
drag her down into the pit, to filth and decay."</p>

<p>It was odd to hear such words from the lips of so
kindly, so wise a man, and one with so profound a
knowledge of human nature. He told me that in all
his years of ministry at M. there was only one illegitimate
birth in the village&mdash;a statement which students
of De Maupassant will find it difficult to believe.</p>

<p>We were talking of certain moral problems intensified
by the war, the perpetually recurring "sex-question,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
not any more insistent perhaps in France than elsewhere,
but obtruding itself less ashamedly upon the
notice. It was the acceptance, the toleration of certain
things that puzzled me, an acceptance which I am sometimes
tempted to believe is due to some deep, wise
understanding of human frailty, of the fierceness of
human passions, the weakness of human will when
Love has taken over the citadel of the heart. Or is it
due to fatalism, the conviction that it is useless to
strive against what cannot be altered, absurd to fight
Nature in her unbridled moods?</p>

<p>The priest, needless to say, neither accepted nor
condoned. He blamed public opinion, above all he
blamed the unbelief of the people, and then he told
me of M. and the purity of the life there. Only one
girl in all those years, and she, after her baby was born,
led so exemplary, so modest a life that its father subsequently
married her, and together they built up one
of the happiest homes in the village. (You will gather
that the Abbé was not above entertaining at least one
popular superstition in that he insinuated that all the
blame rested on the shoulders of the woman.)</p>

<p>One other story he told me which flashed a white
light upon his soul. A certain atheist, one of his
bitterest enemies, came to him one day in deep distress
of mind. His wife, an unbeliever like himself, was
dying, and, dying, was afraid. The man was rich, and
thought he could buy his way and hers into the Kingdom
of Heaven. But the Abbé refused his gold.
"You cannot buy salvation nor ease of conscience,"
he said sternly. "Keep your money; God wants your
heart, and not your purse." He attended the woman,
gave her Christian burial, and asked exactly the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
fee. Not one penny more would he take, nor could
all the atheist's prayers move him.</p>

<p>He told me that he would not bury a man or a woman
living in what he called <i lang="fr">le concubinage civile</i>, people
married by the State only and not by Church and State.
For these, he said, there could only be the burial of a
dog, for they lived in sin, knowing their error as do the
contractors of mixed marriages if they do not ask for
and receive a dispensation. The rules governing these
latter appear to be much the same as those which hold
good in Ireland. No service in a Protestant church
is permitted, and the Protestant must promise that
all children born of the union shall be baptised and
brought up in the Catholic faith. There is no written
contract, and the promise may, of course, be broken, but
if the Catholic is a party to it he is guilty of mortal sin.</p>

<p>You will see that as our classes ran their course&mdash;and
circumstances decreed that I should take the final
lessons alone&mdash;we got very far away from "s" for
plural and "e" for feminine. Exercises corrected,
many an interesting half-hour we passed in the little
parlour, and many a tale of the trenches the Abbé
gathered up for us, and many a "well-founded,
authentic" prophecy of the speedy termination of
the war. Ah, he was so sure he would be in his beloved
M. this winter. Did not his friend the Editor of&mdash;he
mentioned a leading Paris journal&mdash;tell him so?</p>

<p>But this is the war of the unforeseen. Perhaps that
is why some of us dare to believe that when the end
comes it will come suddenly, swiftly, like thunder
pealing through the heavy stillness of a breathless,
sullen night.</p>

<p class="center">REPATRIÉES</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle, the children are
coming!"</p>

<p>Christmas had come and gone in a convulsion of
parties, January had dripped monotonously into the
abyss of time. The day was dank and cheerless, rain&mdash;the
imperturbable rain of France&mdash;was falling placidly,
persistently, yet through the unfathomable seas of
mud that engulf Bar-le-Duc in winter I saw Madame
Lassanne running towards me. I was miry, wet and
exceedingly cross; Madame was several times mirier,
her clothes were a sodden sop, but her eyes were like
a breeze-ruffled pool that the sun has been kissing.
She clutched a telegram in one shaking hand, she waved
it under my eyes, she cried out something quite unintelligible,
for a laugh and a sob caught it and smothered
it as she fled. I watched her splash through the grey
liquid sea&mdash;she was running but she did not know it.
The train was not due for an hour yet.</p>

<p>Some days later I swam out to the farm (you don't
walk in Bar in winter unless you have webbed feet, and
then you fly), and there I found Madame Breda and
the aunt whose name I have most reprehensibly
forgotten, and Roger and Marie, and yet another old
lady, and Madame, and they were all living in one
small room and they all talked together, and Roger&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
discerning infant&mdash;howled at my uniform, and Marie
stared at me out of great round eyes, and gradually
little by little I pieced together the story.</p>

<p>When shells were falling on the village Madame
Breda, as you know, set off with the children, but
turning north instead of south, walked right into the
line of battle. A handful of French (it was in August
1914) were flying before vastly superior German forces.
They rode down the road at breakneck speed. "Sauve
qui peut!" The cry shattered the air. One man's
horse was shot under him. He scrambled to his
feet, terror in his eyes, for the Germans were close
behind. A comrade reined up, in a moment he had
swung himself behind him and the mad race for life
swept on, the men shouting to Madame Breda to fly.
"Sauvez-vous, sauvez-vous." What she read in their
eyes she never forgot. But flight for her and the
children was out of the question, they were literally
too frightened to move. A few minutes later they were
toiling back along the road to a little village called, I
think, Canel, with German soldiers mounting guard
over them. There they were kept for six days, during
three of which no bread was obtainable, and they nearly
died of hunger. Then they were taken to Nantillois,
their old home, where they remained for two months.
Food was scarce, the soldiers brutal. "There are no
potatoes," they cried to the Commandant; "what
shall we eat?" "Il y a des betteraves,"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he replied
coarsely as he turned away.</p>

<p>These French peasants must come of a sturdy stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
they are so difficult to kill. They existed somehow&mdash;only
the baby died.</p>

<p>And then they were marched off again, this time to
Carignan, once a town of perhaps 2,500 inhabitants,
of whom some 1,100 remained. Here they were not
treated badly, the garrison consisting of oldish men,
reservists, with little stomach for the atrocities that
followed in the wake of the first army. At Nantillois
some ugly things appear to have happened, but at
Carignan the Mayor managed to <i lang="fr">tenir tête</i>, behaving like
a hero at first and later like a shrewd and far-seeing
man.</p>

<p>Some day, I hope a volume will be written in honour
of these French mayors. Sermaize, left defenceless,
was an exception. For the most part they stuck to
their posts, shielding and protecting them in every way,
raising indemnities from the very stones, placating irate
commandants, encouraging the stricken, and all too
often dying like gallant gentlemen when the interests
of Kultur demanded that the blood of innocent victims
should smoke upon its altars.</p>

<p>Madame Breda told me that the Mayor of Nantillois
bought up all the flour he could find in the mills and
shops during the first week of war, hiding it so successfully
the Germans never found it. I confess I received
this information with frank incredulity, for knowing
something of the ways of the gentle Hun, I am profoundly
convinced that if you set him in the middle
of the Desert of Sahara, telling him that a grain of
gold had been hidden there, he would nose round till
he found it. And it wouldn't take him long, for his
scent is keen. But Madame was positive. French
wit was more than a match for German cunning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the flour was distributed by a man whose life would
not have been worth five minutes' purchase if his
"crime" had been found out.</p>

<p>In spite of the flour, however, and in spite of the
washing that brought Madame in a small weekly wage,
"ce n'était pas gai, vous savez." One doesn't feel
hilarious on a ration of half-a-pound of meat per week,
half-a-pound of black bread per day, and potatoes and
vegetables doled out by an irascible Commandant.</p>

<p>I wonder what we would feel like if we were obliged
to go to a German officer and beg from him our food?
We would starve first? But what if two small hungry
children clutched at our skirts and wailed for bread?
When the American Relief came in and the people were
able to buy various necessaries, including bacon at
one franc sixty a pound, things were a little better.
To those who were too poor to buy, that gem of a
Mayor gave <i lang="fr">bons</i> (free orders).</p>

<p>And so the months went by. Then one day soldiers
tramped about selecting two people from one family,
three from another, separating mother from daughter,
sister from sister, but happily this time including the
whole Breda family on their list.</p>

<p>"You are to go away."</p>

<p>"Away? Ah, God, where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to Germany, and then to Morocco."</p>

<p>The poor wretches, believing them, were filled with
infinite grief and dismay. They were crowded into
wagons and driven to Longuyon, herded there like
cattle for sixteen days, and finally taken through
Germany into Switzerland and thence into France. In
Germany women wearing Red Cross badges gave them
food, treating them well; at the Swiss frontier they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
were rigorously searched, a man who had one hundred
and fifty francs in German gold being given paper
money instead, and losing, if Madame Breda was
correctly informed, thirty-six francs on the exchange.</p>

<p>At Annemasse there is a <i lang="fr">Bureau des Réfugiés</i> so
splendidly organised that <i lang="fr">repatriés</i> can be put into
immediate touch with their relatives, no mean feat
when you think of the dismemberment of Northern
France.</p>

<p>So behold Madame Breda joyfully telegraphing to
Madame Lassanne, and the latter waiting at the
station with tears raining down her face, and limbs
trembling so much they refused to support her!</p>

<p>Poor soul! The end of her calvary was not yet.
Roger did not know her. And his nerves had been so
much affected by what he, baby though he was, had
gone through that for weeks he hid his face in his
grandmother's arms and screamed when his mother
tried to kiss him. Screamed, too, at sudden noises, at
the approach of any stranger, or at sight of a brightly-lighted
room. No wonder he howled at the uniform.</p>

<p>And old Madame Breda, staunch, loyal thing that she
was, had been too sorely tried. The long strain, the
months of haunting anxiety and dread had eaten away
her strength, and soon after coming to Bar she sank
quietly to rest.</p>

<p>She talked to me of Carignan once or twice, saying
it was a vast training-camp for German recruits, mere
boys (<i lang="fr">des vrais gosses</i>), few over seventeen years of
age.</p>

<p>Once a French aviator, hovering over the town, was
obliged to descend owing to some engine trouble. He
was caught, tried as a spy and condemned to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Asking for a French priest to hear his last confession,
he was told it could not be permitted. A German
ministered to him instead (what a refinement of
cruelty!), and remaining with him to the end, declared
afterwards that he died "comme un héros, un Chrétien,
et un brave."</p>

<p>Another aviator, similarly caught, was also shot,
though both, by every rule of the game, should have
been treated as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, c'est un vrai calvaire qu'on
souffre là bas," cried Madame Breda, tears standing
thick in her eyes; and thinking of other <i lang="fr">repatriées</i> whom
I had met and whose stories burned in the memory
I knew that she spoke only the truth. For <i lang="fr">là-bas</i> is
prison. It is home robbed of all its sacredness, its
beauty, its joy, its privacy; it is life without freedom,
and under the shadow of a great fear. Shall I tell you
of those other <i lang="fr">repatriées</i>? I promised to spare you
atrocities, but there is a martyrdom which should call
forth all our sympathy and all our indignation, and
they, poor souls, have endured it.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Madame Ballay is a young, slight, dark-eyed woman,
wife of a railway employee, into whose room I stumbled
accidentally one day when looking for some one else,
an "accident" which happened so frequently in Bar
we took it as a matter of course. No matter how
unceremonious our entry, our reception was invariably
the same, and almost invariably had the same ending&mdash;that
of a new name inscribed upon our books, a fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
recipient gratefully acknowledging much-needed help.
Almost invariably, but not quite. Once at least the
ending was not routine. A dark landing, several
doors. I knock tentatively at one, a voice shouts
<i lang="fr">Entrez</i>, and I fling open the door to see&mdash;well, to see
a blue uniform lying on the floor and a large individual
rubbing himself vigorously with a towel. "Pardon,
Madame!" he exclaimed, pausing in his towelling. He
was not in the least nonplussed, but for my part, not
having come to France to study the nude, I fled&mdash;fled
precipitately and nearly fatally, for the stairs were as
dark as the landing, and my eyes were still filled with
the wonder of the vision. And though many months
have gone by, I am still at a loss to know why he told
me to come in!</p>

<p>But nothing will ever teach me discretion, and so
I still knock at wrong doors, though not always with
such disastrous results, and often with excellent ones,
as it has enabled us to help people who would have been
too shy or too proud to knock at <em>our</em> door and ask to
be inscribed upon our books.</p>

<p>When the war broke out the Ballays, whose home was
down Belmont way, were living in Longuyon, where
Monsieur had been sent some two years before. They
had very few friends, so when the mobilisation order
came, when from every church steeple rang out the clear,
vibrant, emotion-laden call to arms, Madame was left
alone and unprotected with her baby girl. There was
no time to get away. The Germans surged over the
frontier with incredible swiftness, and almost before the
inhabitants knew that war had begun were in the
streets. Then realisation came with awful rapidity,
for Hell broke loose in the town. Shots rang out, wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
screams of terror, oaths, shoutings, the rush of frightened
feet, of heavy, brutal pursuit. Women's sobs throbbed
upon the air, the wailing of children rose shrill and high;
drunken ribald song, hammering upon doors, orders
sharply given! Madame cowering in her kitchen
saw ... heard.... She gathered her child into her
arms. Where could they fly for safety? The door
was broken open, a German, drunk, maddened, rushed
in and seized her. Struggling, she screamed for help,
and her screams attracted the attention of some men
in a room below. They dashed up, and the soldier,
alarmed, perhaps ashamed, slunk away. Snatching up
the child, the unfortunate mother fled to the woods.
There, with many other women and children, she
wandered for two days and two nights. They had no
food, nothing but one tin of condensed milk, which they
managed to open and with which they coloured the
water they gave the children. Starving, exhausted,
unable to make her way down through France, she
was compelled to return to the town, three-quarters
of which, including the richer residential portions, had
been wantonly fired. The few people she had known
were gone, her own house destroyed. She wandered
about the streets for five days and nights, penniless and
starving, existing on scraps picked up in the gutter,
sleeping in doorways, on the steps of the church.
Then she stumbled upon a Belmont woman living in a
street that had escaped destruction. The woman was
kind to her, taking her in and giving her lodging, but
unable to give her food, as she had not enough for
herself.</p>

<p>Madame was nearly desperate when some German
soldiers asked her to do their washing, paying her a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
sous, with which she was able to buy food for herself
and the child. But she was often hungry, there was
never enough for two. The men were reservists,
oldish and quiet, doing no harm and living decently.
It was the first armies that were guilty of atrocities,
and in Longuyon their score runs high. They behaved
like madmen. Ninety civilians were wantonly shot
in the streets, among them being some women and
children. A woman, Madame said, took refuge in a cellar
with several children&mdash;five, I think, in all; a soldier
rushed in with levelled rifle. She flung herself in front
of the little ones, but with an oath he fired, flung her
body on one side and then killed the children. Soldiers
leaning from a window shot a man as he walked down
the street. They caught some civilians, told one he
was innocent, another that he had fired on them,
shot some, allowed others to go free; they quarrelled
among themselves, they shot one another. Women, as
a rule, they did not shoot. But the women paid&mdash;paid
the heaviest price that can be demanded of them;
nor did the presence of her children save one mother
from shame. I have heard of these soldiers clambering
to the roofs and crawling like evil beasts from skylight
to skylight, peering down into dark attics and roof-rooms,
searching for the shuddering victims who found
no way of escape. And then, their rage and fury spent,
they swept on, crying, "Paris kaput, À Paris, Calais,
Londres. London kaput. In a fortnight" ... and
the reservists marching in took their places.</p>

<p>For seven months Madame Ballay was unable to
leave the town. She knew nothing of what was happening
in France, heard no news of her husband, did not
know whether he was dead or alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I was well off," she said, "because of the
washing. There were women&mdash;oh, rich women,
Mademoiselle, bien élevées&mdash;who slowly starved in the
streets, homeless, houseless, living on scraps, on offal
and refuse. Sometimes we spared them a little, but
we had never enough for ourselves."</p>

<p>Seven months jealously guarding the two-year old
baby from harm and then repatriation, a long, weary
journey into Germany, a night in a fortress, then by
slow stages into Switzerland and over the frontier to
France.</p>

<p>What a home-coming it might have been! But the
baby had sickened; underfed and improperly nourished,
it grew rapidly worse, it had no strength with which to
fight, and M. Ballay, hurrying down from Bar-le-Duc
in response to his wife's telegram (she discovered his
whereabouts through the <i lang="fr">Bureau des Réfugiés</i>), arrived
just two hours after the last sod had been laid upon its
tiny grave.</p>

<p>"She was my only comfort during all those months,"
the poor creature said, tears raining down her face, "and
now I have lost her." When she had recovered her
self-control I told her I knew of people who refused to
believe stories of atrocities, and would certainly refuse
to believe hers.</p>

<p>"It is quite true," she said simply, "I <span class="smcap">SAW</span> it," and
then she added that the reservists sometimes gave food
to the starving women who were reduced to beg for
bread. "When they had it they would give soup to
the children, but often they had none to spare, and the
women suffered terribly."</p>

<p>Think of it, in all the rigour of a northern winter.
Think of this for delicately nurtured women. Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
shivered as she spoke of it, and it was easy to tell what
had painted the dark shadows under her eyes and the
weary lines&mdash;lines that should not have been there for
many a long year yet&mdash;round her mouth.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>For us the whole system&mdash;if, indeed, there is any
system&mdash;of repatriation was involved in mystery.
Convoys were sent back at erratic intervals, chosen at
haphazard, young and old, strong and weak, just anyhow
as if in blind obedience to a whim. No method
appeared to govern procedure, convoys being sometimes
sent off just before an offensive, sometimes during
weeks of comparative calm.</p>

<p>Probably the key to the mystery lay in the military
situation; we noticed, for instance, that many were
sent back just before the offensive at Verdun. Food
problems, too, may have exerted an influence, as every
<i lang="fr">repatriée</i> assured us that Germany was starving. In
the winter of 1915-1916 so many of these unfortunate
people crossed the frontier, the Society decided to
equip a Sanatorium for them in the Haute-Savoie,
near Annemasse. Many were tubercular, others
threatened with consumption, but no sooner was the
Sanatorium ready than the Germans, as might be
expected, stopped the exodus, and it was not until the
following winter or autumn that they began to come in
numbers again. Of these, a doctor who worked among
them for many weeks gave me a pathetic account.
Their plight, she said, was pitiable. They wept
unrestrainedly at finding themselves on French soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
again; even the strongest had lost her nerve. Shaken,
trembling in every limb, starting at every sound, they
had all the appearance of people suffering from severe
mental shock; many were so confused as to be almost
unintelligible, others had lost power of decision, clearness
of thought, directness of action. The old were
like children. There were women who sat day after
day, plunged in profound silence from which nothing
could rouse them. Others chattered, chattered unceasingly
all day long, babbling to any one who would listen,
utterly unable to control themselves. Some were
thin to emaciation, others, on the contrary, were rosy
and plump. Of food they never had enough. That
was the complaint of them all. The American supplies
kept them from starvation. "One would have died
of hunger only for that," they said, but the Germans
would not allow free distribution. What they got they
had to pay for, but in some Communes the Mayors
were able to arrange that penniless folk should pay
after the war, <i>i. e.</i> the Commune lent the money or
paid on condition that it would be refunded later.</p>

<p>Coffee made chiefly from acorns, black bread, half-a-pound
of meat per week (a supply which sometimes
failed), these Germany provided&mdash;that is to say, allowed
to be sold, and it is but just to add that though every
woman declared that the Boches themselves went
hungry, those I spoke to added that they never
tampered with the American supplies, though one or
two mentioned that inferior black flour was sometimes
substituted for white of a better quality. Paraffin was
rarely obtainable, and fuel scarce.</p>

<p>Martial law, of course, prevails. House doors must
never be locked, windows must be left unbarred, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
are fixed hours for going to the fields, fixed hours after
which one must be indoors at night. Any soldier or
officer may walk into any house at any hour he chooses.
"You never know when the butt-end of a rifle will
burst your door open and a soldier walk in." A man
passing down the street and looking in at a window
sees a woman with her children sitting down to their
midday meal. It is frugal enough, but it smells good.</p>

<p>He realises that he is hungry, he stalks in and helps
himself to what he wants. If they go without, what
matter? Falsehoods of every kind are freely circulated.
France has been defeated; England has betrayed her;
the English have seized Calais; the English have been
driven into the sea; London has fallen. With the
utmost duplicity every effort is made to undermine
faith in the Alliance, to persuade people that England
is a traitor to their cause, hoodwinking them in order
to gain her own ends.</p>

<p>A peasant told one of our workers that she, too, had
been a prisoner, and though hungry, was not otherwise
ill-treated. One day when she and the other women
went to get their soup the Germans, as they ladled it
out, said, "There is dessert for you to-day" (the
dessert being repatriation). "Yes, you are going back
to France; but there is no bread there, so we don't
know how you will live. You must go through Switzerland,
where there is no food either. The best thing
for you to do is to throw yourselves into Lake
Constance."</p>

<p>It is by such apish tricks as these that the lot of the
unhappy people is made almost intolerable.</p>

<p>No letters, no newspapers, no news, only a few guarded
lines at rare intervals from a prisoner in Germany&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
is it any wonder that the strongest nerves give way,
and that hysterical women creep over the frontier to
France? They are alone, they are cold and hungry, and
oh, how desperately they are afraid! They dare not
chat together in the street, a soldier soon stops all <span class="smcap">THAT</span>,
and at any moment some pitiful unintentional offence
may send them under escort into Germany.</p>

<p>A woman owns a foal, chance offers her an opportunity
of selling it; she does so, and is sentenced to
imprisonment in Germany for a year. She has sinned
against an unknown or imperfectly understood law.
She has no counsel to defend her; her trial, if she is
honoured with one, is the hollowest mockery.</p>

<p>There is living in the rue St Mihiel in Bar-le-Duc, or
there was in the spring of 1917, a woman who spent
six months in a German prison. Her offence? A very
natural one. She had heard nothing of her husband
for two years; then one day a neighbour told her she
had reason to believe that he was a prisoner in Germany.
A hint to that effect had come in a letter. If Madame
wrote to a soldier in such and such a prison he might
be able to give her news of him.</p>

<p>The letter was written, despatched, and opened by
the German censor. Now it is a crime to try and elicit
information about a prisoner even if he happens to
be your husband, and even if you have heard nothing
of him for two long years. Madame was separated
from her children and speedily found herself in a German
prison&mdash;one, too, which was not reserved for French
or Belgian women, but was the common prison of a
large town. Here she was classed with the "drunks
and disorderlies," the riff-raff, women of no character,
and classed, too, with Belgian nuns and gentlewomen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
many of them of the highest rank, whose offence was
not that of writing letters, but of shielding, or being
accused of shielding, Belgian soldiers from the Germans
who were hunting them down like rats.</p>

<p>Compelled to wear prison clothes, to eat the miserable
prison fare, work and associate with women of the
worst character, many of them had been there for years,
and some were serving life-sentences. Representations
had been made on their behalf, but for a long time in
vain. Then as a great concession they were given
permission to wear their own clothes and exercise in
a yard apart, but the concession was a grudging one,
and when one of the nuns dared to ask for more food
she was promptly transferred back again to the main
building.</p>

<p>When the release of prisoners is being discussed
round the Peace Table, it is to be hoped that the needs
of these women will not be forgotten.</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p>It happened to be my fortune to visit within a fortnight
two women, natives of Conflans-Jarny, both
<i lang="fr">repatriées</i> and neither aware that the other was in the
town. Indeed, I think they were unacquainted. Yet
each told me identically the same story. One was the
wife of a railway employee, the other of rather better
position and a woman of much refinement of mind.
Both came to Bar early in 1917, and both were profoundly
moved as they told their tale.</p>

<p>"We did not know the Germans were coming,"
they said. "People thought they would pass over on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the other side of the hill." And so, in spite of heavy
anxiety, Conflans went about its usual affairs one
brilliant August day. There were only a few troops
in the town&mdash;even the military authorities do not seem
to have suspected danger; but the sun had not
travelled far across the cloudless sky when down from
the hill a woman, half distraught, half dead with fear
came flying.</p>

<p>"The Germans!" she gasped, and looking up Conflans
saw a wide tongue of flame leaping upwards&mdash;the
woman's farmhouse burning&mdash;and wave upon wave of
grey-coated men surging like a wind-driven sea down
every road, down the hill-side. The soldiers seized
their rifles, their hasty preparations were soon made,
they poured volley after volley into the oncoming mass,
they fought till every cartridge was expended and their
comrades lay thick on the ground. Then the Germans,
who outnumbered them ten, twenty, fifty to one,
clubbed their rifles and the massacre began. There was
no quarter given that day. "They beat them to death,
Mademoiselle, and we&mdash;ah, God! we their wives, their
sisters, their mothers looked on and saw it done."
Conflans lay defenceless under the pitiless sun. Some
twenty-seven civilians, including the priest, were
promptly butchered in the streets, and one young
mother, whose baby, torn from her arms, was tossed
upon a bayonet, was compelled to dig a hole in her
garden, compelled to put the little lacerated body in a
box, compelled to bury it and fill in the grave. Other
things happened, too, of which neither woman cared to
speak.</p>

<p>And so Conflans-Jarny passed into German hands.</p>

<p>As time wore on Russian prisoners were encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
there. They worked in the fields, in the mines and in
the hospitals.</p>

<p>"Ah, les pauvres gens! Figurez-vous, Mademoiselle,
in the winter when snow was on the ground, when
there was a wind&mdash;oh, but a wind of ice! they used to
march past our street clad only in their cotton suits.
Some had not even a shirt. They were dying of cold,
but they were so strong they could not die. They
were blue and pinched. They shook as if they had an
ague. Sometimes, but not often, we were able to give
them a little hot coffee; they were so grateful, they
tried to thank us.... (Tears were pouring down
Madame Cholley's face as she spoke.) I worked in the
hospital because I had no money with which to buy
food&mdash;they gave me two sous an hour&mdash;and I used to
see <i lang="fr">les pauvres Russes</i> grubbing in the dust-bins and
manure heaps looking for scraps; they would gnaw
filth, rotten vegetable stumps, offal, tearing it with
their teeth like dogs. Once as they marched I saw one
step into a field to pick up a carrot that lay on the
ground. The guard shot him dead. And those that
worked in the mines&mdash;ah, God only knows what they
suffered. They lived underground, one did not know,
but strange stories reached us. So many disappeared,
they say they were killed down there and buried in the
mine."</p>

<p>Then silence fell on the little room, silence broken
only by the sound of Madame's quiet weeping.</p>

<p>Presently she told me that the allowance of food was
one pound of coffee a month, coffee made chiefly from
acorns, four tins of condensed milk at nineteen sous a
tin, for three people, and one pound of fat per head per
month. Haricot beans were not rationed, and bread she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
must have had, too, but I omitted to make a note of the
amount. There was no paraffin, so in the winter she
tried to make candles out of thread and oil, but the
latter was dear and scarce. Meat "had not been seen
in the commune for a year."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the Germans are starving."</p>

<p>This was the text from which every <i lang="fr">repatrié</i> tried to
draw comfort, and it may be inferred that there was
shortage in the villages. Once I even heard of shortage
in a hospital, my informant being a young man, manager
of a big branch store in the Northern Meuse, who had
been married just three months before war was declared.
He was wounded in August 1914 and taken to Germany,
where one leg was amputated, the other, also badly
injured, being operated on at least twice. Yet in
December 1916 it was not healed. He was well
treated on the whole, he told me, but his food was
wretched. Coffee and bread in the morning, thin soup
and vegetables at midday, coffee and bread at night.</p>

<p>"When we complained the orderlies said we got
exactly the same food as they did," and he, too, added
the unfailing, "Germany is starving."</p>

<p>A pathetic little picture he and his wife made in
their shabby room, she a young, pretty, capable thing
who nursed him assiduously, he helpless on his <i lang="fr">chaise-longue</i>
with yet another operation hanging over him.
The wound was suppurating, it was feared some shrapnel
still remained in the leg. Pension? He had none,
not even the <em>allocation</em>. He had applied, of course, but
was told he must wait till after the war. He had not
even got the <i lang="fr">Medaille Militaire</i> or the <i lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i>,
though he said it was customary in France to give
either one or the other to mutilated and blinded men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>There must be many sad home-comings for these
<i lang="fr">repatriés</i>. So many get back to find that those they
loved have been killed or have died while they were
away, so many return to find Death wrapping his wings
closely about the makeshift home that awaits them.</p>

<p>"They sent me to Troyes because my husband was
working on the railway there, but for a whole day I
could get no news of him. Then they said he was at
Châlons in the hospital. I hurried there&mdash;he died two
hours after my arrival in my arms."</p>

<p>How often one hears such stories. And yet one
day the world may hear a still more tragic one, the day
when the curtain of silence and darkness that has fallen
over the kidnapped thousands of Lille and Belgium is
lifted, and we know the truth of them at last.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">STORM-WRACK FROM VERDUN</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>"The French are evacuating some villages near
Verdun, and I hear there are a number of refugees at
the Marché Couvert to-night," one of the coterie remarked
as she came in one evening from her rounds.
It seemed a little odd that villages should be evacuated
by the <em>French</em> just then, but we had long since ceased
to be surprised at anything. In the War Zone everything
is possible and the unexpected is the probable,
so we piled on waterproofs and goloshes and woollies,
for it was a cold, wet night, and set forth in all our
panoply of ugliness for the Covered Market.</p>

<p>The streets were as dark as the pit, only a pale cold
gleam showing where the river lay. The sky was
heavily overcast, a keen wind cut down from the
north. The pavement on the quay was broken and
rough, we splashed into pools, we jolted into crevasses,
we bent our heads to the whistling storm, we reached
the market at last. The wide gates were open, and the
vast floor, with its rows of empty stalls, loomed like a
vault before us. The heavy, sickly odour of stale
vegetables, of sausage and of meat, of unaired space
where humanity throngs on several days a week
clutched at us as we went in. We were to become very
familiar with it in the weeks that followed&mdash;weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
during which it daily grew heavier, sicklier, more
nauseating, more horrible.</p>

<p>On the left of the market as you enter from the quay
there is a broad wooden staircase which leads to a still
broader wooden gallery that runs right round the
building. At the top we turned to the right. The
gallery was dimly lighted, dark figures huddled on it
here and there; we crossed the lower end and found
ourselves in a wide space, really a large unenclosed
room which had been hastily improvised as a kitchen.
A short counter divided it into two very unequal
portions, in the smaller being some old <i lang="fr">armoires</i>, two
large steamers or boilers, a table piled with plates,
dishes and small and handleless bowls, used instead of
cups. Another littered with glasses, and in the corner
a big barrel of wine.</p>

<p>Two or three women were probing the contents of
the boilers; men rushed excitedly about, one was
chopping bread, another filling jugs with wine, a <i lang="fr">garde-champêtre</i>
with a hoarse voice was shouting unintelligible
orders, a gendarme or two hung about getting
in everybody's way, and in the outer space seethed a
mob of men, women and children in every condition
of dishevelment, mud, misery and distress. Five or
six long tables with benches of the light garden-seat
variety crossed this space. Seated as tightly as they
could be squeezed together were more refugees devouring
a steaming soup. Everything wore an air of
confusion; the light was bad, one paraffin lamp
swaying dimly over the scene. We saw a door, guarded
by two officials, <i lang="fr">garde-champêtres</i>, or something of the
kind; we passed through, and there we saw a sight
which I am convinced no one of us will ever forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Picture an enormous room, like a barrack dormitory.
There are windows&mdash;some five or six&mdash;on each side.
Half-way down and opposite one another there are
two stoves in which good fires are burning. The glow
from the open doors falls on the gloom and throws
into relief the stooped figures, broken with fatigue,
that cluster dejectedly round them. A lamp throws
fitful shadows. The air is brown. Perhaps you think
this an absurd thing to say, but it was so. It hung
like a pale brown veil over the room, and as weeks went
by the colour deepened, and in breathing it one had the
sensation of drawing something solid into one's lungs.
It smelt, too, with an indescribable smell that became
intensified every day, until at last a time came when it
required a definite effort to penetrate it. It seemed to
hurl you back from the doorway; you began to think
it must be sentient. It was certainly stifling, poisonous,
fœtid, and as I write I seem to feel it in my nostrils
again, seem to feel the same nausea that seized us
when we breathed it then. Over all the floor-space
there is straw, thick, tossed-up straw, through which,
running past the stoves, are two narrow lanes, one
down either side. And on the straw lie human beings,
not many as yet, only those who have supped, or who,
waiting for the meal, have thrown themselves down in
the last stages of physical and mental exhaustion.
Babies wail, women are sobbing, the <i lang="fr">gardes-champêtres</i>
shout in rough voices. Bales, bundles, hand-grips,
baskets lie on the straw; there an old woman is lying
wretchedly, her head on a canvas bag; here two boys
are sprawling across one another in heavy, uncouth,
abandoned attitudes.</p>

<p>We go about among the people talking to them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
they are dazed and weary. Did we learn that night
that the great attack upon Verdun had begun, or did
we only know of it some days later? So packed with
incident were those first days I cannot remember, but
it seems to me now that knowledge came later, and that
we came home that night wondering, questioning, our
hearts filled with pity for those we had left homeless
upon that awful straw.</p>

<p>We came again into the outer room. More refugees
were arriving, little groups of bewildered creatures,
muddy, travel-stained, dog-weary, yet wonderfully
patient and resigned. There are no sanitary arrangements
of any kind in the building, there is not a basin,
nor a towel, nor a cake of soap of which the refugees
can make use.</p>

<p>The next evening we go again, supposing that the
evacuation must be complete, that this river of human
misery will cease to flow through the town, but little
by little we realise that it is only beginning.</p>

<p>Days lengthen into weeks, and still the refugees come
through. We know now that Verdun is in danger,
that the Germans have advanced twelve kilomètres;
we watch breathlessly for news, the town is listening,
intent, anxious, and every day the crowds at the market
grow denser. We spend much of our time there now,
we have brought over basins, and soap and towels;
we have put a table in the inner room, so that those
who will may refresh themselves and wash. The
rooms are packed. There must be at least three
hundred or four hundred people, and still more drift
in. Some have been in open cattle trucks for thirty-six
hours under rain and snow, for the north wind has
become keener and the rain has hardened into fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
sleety snow; it is bitterly cold, the roads and streets
are awash with mud, women's skirts are soddened
to the knee, men are splashed shoulder high. A number
of people have fallen ill <i lang="fr">en route</i>, others, seriously ill,
have been compelled to leave their beds and struggle
as best they might with the healthy in their rush to
safety. We hear that the civil hospital is full, that
babies have been born on the journey down&mdash;been
born and have died and were buried by the way.
Despair rides on many a shoulder, fear still darkens
many eyes. Some have escaped from a storm of
shell-fire, many have had to walk long distances, for
the railway lines have been cut. Verdun is isolated&mdash;Nixieville
is the nearest point to which a train may go&mdash;and
all have left their homes unguarded, some being
already blown to atoms, others momently threatened
with a like fate.</p>

<p>In spite of all our anxiety as we made our way to the
market that second night, laden with basins and jugs,
<i lang="fr">seaux hygiéniques</i>, and various other comforts, we
could not help laughing. We must have cut funny
figures staggering along in the darkness with our
uncouth burdens. Happily it <span class="smcap">WAS</span> dark, and then not
happily, as some one trips over an unseen obstacle
and is only saved from an ignominious sprawl in the
mire by wild evolutions shattering to the nerve. At
the market we cast what might be called our "natural
feelings" on one side and bored our way into the
throng, our strange utensils and luggage desperately
exposed to view. <i lang="fr">Que voulez-vous? C'est la guerre!</i>
The phrase covers many vicissitudes, but it did not
cover the shyest of our coterie when, having deposited
her burden on the gallery for a moment in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
help a poor woman, she heard a crash and a round
French oath, and turning, beheld a certain official
doing a weird cake-walk over things that were never
intended to be trodden upon by man. It was the same
shy member whose indignation at the lack of proper
accommodation bore all her native timidity away
and enabled her to persuade the same official to curtain
off a small corner at the far end of the gallery and furnish
it as a toilet-room for the women, a corner which
to our eternal amusement was ever afterwards known
as "le petit coin des dames anglaises." However, the
<i lang="fr">petit coin</i> was not in existence for two or three days,
and while it was in process of manufacture we were
more than once moved to violence of language, though
we realised that physical fatigue may reach a point
at which, if conditions be unfavourable, no veneer of
civilisation can save some individuals from a lapse
into primitive ways.</p>

<p>In the inner room the crowd was dense as we struggled
in with our apparatus for washing. There was something
essentially sordid in the scene. The straw
looked dirty, the people were muddier, more wretched.
Many were weeping, and very many lying in unrestful
contorted attitudes upon the ground. In such a crowd
no one dare leave her luggage unguarded, and so it
was either gripped tightly to the body, even in sleep,
or else was utilised as a pillow. And no one of those
who came in by train or <i lang="fr">camion</i> was allowed to bring
more than he or she could carry.</p>

<p>All the misery, all the suffering, all the heart-break
of war seemed concentrated there, and then quite
suddenly out of ugliness and squalor came beauty. A
tall woman with resigned, beautiful face detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
herself from the throng, a naked baby wrapped in a
towel in her arms. As unconcernedly, as unselfconsciously
as if she were at home in her own kitchen
she came to the table, filled a basin with warm water,
and sitting down, bathed the lusty crowing thing that
kicked, and chewed its fists, gurgling with delight.</p>

<p>It was the second time she had been evacuated, she
told us. She had seven children, her husband was a
farmer and well-to-do. Their home destroyed, they
had escaped in August 1914, taking refuge in Verdun,
where they had remained, gathering a little furniture
together again, trying to make a home once more.
She neither wept nor complained. I think she was
long past both. Fate had taken its will of her, she
could but bow her head, impotent in the storm. Her
children, in spite of their experiences, looked neat and
clean, they were nicely spoken and refined in manner.
Soon the dusky shadows of the room swallowed her
up and the human whirlpool swirled round us once
more, from it emerging Monsieur B., the "certain
official," and his wife who merely came to look round,
who made no offer to help, and who must not be
confounded with <span class="smcap">THE</span> Madame B. who was the special
providence of our lives.</p>

<p>What Monsieur B. thought when he found us more
or less in possession I cannot say, but this I know&mdash;that
he, in common with every one with whom our
work brought us into official contact, showed himself
sympathetic, helpful, forbearing and kind. He fell
in with suggestions that must have seemed to him
quixotic to a degree; he never insinuated, as he might
have done, that our activities bordered upon interference,
nor did he ask us how English officials would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
have received French women if the situation had been
reversed! At first, thinking, no doubt, that the
evacuation was only an affair of two or three days,
none of the charitable women of the town thought it
necessary to visit the Market, so all the care of the
unfortunates was left in the hands of some half-dozen
men; but later on, as the stream continued to pour
through, and the congestion became more and more
acute, many women, some after a hard day's work,
came in the evenings and helped to serve the meals.
Of course, as soon as they took things in hand we slid
into the background, though we found our work just
as engrossing and as imperative as ever, but how
Madame B. could have walked through those rooms
that evening and have gone away without making
the smallest effort to ameliorate the conditions baffled
our comprehension. However, she added to the
gaiety of nations by one remark, so we forgave her.
Seeing some respectably-dressed women who had
obviously neither washed nor combed for days, we
indicated the "washing-stand."</p>

<p>"We are too tired to-night," they said. "In the
morning...."</p>

<p>"One would have thought they would have found it
refreshing," we murmured to Madame B., who was
essaying small talk under large difficulties.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I cannot understand it. For me, I wash
myself every night, even if I am tired." The exquisiteness
of that "<i lang="fr">même</i> si je suis fatiguée" carried us
through many a hectic hour.</p>

<p>And hours at the market were apt to be hectic.
The serving of meals was a delirium. In vain we
begged the guards to keep the door of communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
closed, and allow only as many as there was room for
at the tables to come to the "dining-room" at a time.
They admitted the soundness of the scheme, but they
made no attempt to carry it out. Consequently, no
sooner was a meal ready than ravenous people poured
out in swarms, snatched places at the tables and filled
up every inch of space between, ready to fall into a
chair the moment it was vacated. We had to elbow,
push, worm or drive a way from table to table, from
individual to individual; we grew hoarse from shouting
"<i lang="fr">Attention!</i>" We lost time, patience, breath and
energy, and meals that might have been served with
despatch were a kind of wild scrimmage, through
which we "dribbled" with cauldrons of boiling soup
or vast platters of meat, with plates piled like the
leaning Tower of Pisa&mdash;be it written in gold upon our
tombstones that the towers never fell&mdash;or with telescopic
armsful of glasses and bowls. And against us
rose not only the solid wall of expectant and famished
humanity, but the incoming tide of new arrivals, all
of whom had to pass between the tables and the
serving counters in order to reach the inner room.
Sometimes six hundred had to be fed, sometimes as
many as twelve hundred passed through in a day, and&mdash;triumph
of French organisation&mdash;very rarely did
supplies run out, very rarely were the big tins of
"singe"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (which the shy member really supposed
was monkey!) brought into play. The meals themselves
were excellent. Hot soup from a good <i lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i>
made from beef with quantities of vegetables, then
the beef served with its carrots and turnips, leeks, etc.,
that cooked with it, then cheese or jam, and wine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Coffee and bread in the morning, a three-course meal
at midday, another at six&mdash;no wonder Bar-le-Duc was
eulogised. Never had such a reception been dreamed
of. "The food was delicious, excellent.... We shall
have grateful memories of Bar."</p>

<p>But the awful sleeping accommodation weighed
heavily on our consciences&mdash;the brown pall of atmosphere,
the fœtid <span class="smcap">SOLID</span> smell, the murky lamp, the
fitful glow of the fires, and on the floor on the dirty
inadequate straw a dense mass of human beings.
Lying in their clothes just as they came from the
station, or as they left the big <i lang="fr">camions</i> in which many
were driven down, not daring even to unlace their
boots, they were wedged so tightly we thought not even
a child could have found space. Some, tossing in their
sleep, had flung themselves across neighbours too
exhausted to protest; acute discomfort was suggested
in every pose; many were sitting up, propped against
their bundles; children lay anyhow, a heterogenous
mass of arms and legs, or pillowed their heads against
their mothers.</p>

<p>"Surely," it was said as we came away, "surely
the cup of human misery has never been so full."</p>

<p>Yet we were told the next day that during the night a
fresh convoy had come in, and that the <i lang="fr">garde-champêtre</i>,
tramping up and down the narrow lane in the straw,
shouted, "Serrez-vous, serrez-vous," forcing the
wretched creatures to be in still closer proximity, to
sleep in even greater discomfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Soon the numbers grew too large for the space, and
the long gallery running down from the "dining-room"
was converted into a sleeping apartment, a screen of
white calico or linen serving as an outer wall. The
upper end through which we passed in order to gain
access to the original rooms was utilised for meals,
a number of tables being brought in and ranged as
closely as possible together. Even then the congestion
and confusion continued; they were, indeed,
an integral part of all Marché Couvert activities, but
to our great relief the sleeping quarters were improved.
A number of palliasse cases, the gift of a rich woman
of the town, were filled with straw, and over most we
were able to pin detachable slips made from wheat
bags, an immense number of which&mdash;made from
strong, but soft linen thread&mdash;had been offered to us
at a moderate price by the Chamber of Commerce
acting through the Mayor. Three of these, or four,
according to the size required, sewn cannily together
made excellent sheets&mdash;greatly sought after by the
refugees&mdash;indeed, we turned them to all kinds of use
as time went on. The slips were invaluable now, as,
needless to say, the palliasse covers would have been
in a disgusting condition in a week, but it was not
until the Society presented the new dormitory with
twelve iron bedsteads and some camp beds that we
felt that Civilisation was lifting up her head again.
The beds were placed together at the far end of the
dormitory and were primarily intended for sick people
or for better-class women who, unable to find a lodging
in the town, had to accept the doubtful hospitality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the market. Unhappily there were many of these,
and it was heartrending to see women sitting up in the
comfortless chairs all night in the cold eating-place
rather than face the horror of the straw and the
crowded common-room.</p>

<p>Once the beds were installed that contingency no
longer arose, though Heaven knows the new apartment
was squalid and miserable enough; the beds
ranged at the lower end, the palliasses running in
close-packed rows by each wall, space enough in the
middle to walk between, but no more.</p>

<p>One day we found one of our camp beds at the upper
end with a fox-terrier sitting on it, and on inquiry
were told that a <i lang="fr">garde</i> had taken it, evicting two poor
old women as he did so. Now we had never intended
those beds for lusty officials, so we very naturally
protested, but a more than tactful hint reduced us to
silence. The <i lang="fr">gardes</i> had it in their power to make
things very unpleasant for us if they felt so inclined;
it would be politic to say nothing. Having no official
standing, we said nothing. What we thought is immaterial.
Later the gendarme was the Don Juan of
an incident to which only a Guy de Maupassant could
do justice. There, in all that misery, in that makeshift
apartment packed with suffering humanity, with
children and young girls, with modest and disgusted
women looking on, human passions broke through
every code of decency and restraint. The scandal
lasted for three days, then the woman was sent away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the news from Verdun was becoming
graver. The roads were cut to pieces, motor-cars,
gun-carriages, <i lang="fr">camions</i> were burying themselves axle-deep
in the mire; one road impassable, another was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
made, but by the time the first was repaired the
second was a slough. The weather, always in league
with the Germans, showed no sign of taking up, wet
snow was falling heavily.... "Three more days of
this and Verdun must fall."</p>

<p>Soldiers subsequently told us that it was the <i lang="fr">camion</i>
drivers who saved the situation, for they stuck to their
wagons day and night, one snatching rest and sleep
while another drove. They poured through Bar-le-Duc
in hundreds, the roar of traffic thundering down the
Boulevard all day long. In the night we would lie
awake listening. It sounded like a rough sea dragging
back from a stone-strewn shore. Once, if soldier
tales be true, "the Boches could have walked into
Verdun with their rifles over their shoulders. Four
days and four nights we lay in the open, Mademoiselle.
Our trenches were blown to pieces, we were cut off
by the barrage, we had no food but our emergency
rations, no ammunition could reach us. Then our
guns became silent. The Boches, thinking it was a
ruse, a trap, were afraid to come on. They thought
we were reserving fire to mow them down at close
quarters, so they waited twelve hours, and during
that time our <i lang="fr">camions</i> brought the ammunition up,
and when they did come on we were ready for them."</p>

<p>One lad of twenty, who told me the same tale, was
home on leave when I chanced to visit his mother and
found the family at lunch. To celebrate his return
they were having a little feast&mdash;the feast consisting
of a tin of sardines and a bottle of red wine, in addition
to the usual soup and bread. The boy was a handsome
creature, full of life and high spirits, and in no way
daunted by experiences that would have tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
nerve of many an older man. He had been buried
alive three times, twice by the collapse of a trench,
once by that of a dug-out into which he and four
others crawled under a storm of shells. "Fortunately
I was the first to go in, for a shell burst just outside,
<em>ploomb</em>! killed three and wounded one of my companions.
The wounded man and I dug and scratched
our way out at the back."</p>

<p>He, too, he said, had been without food for four days.</p>

<p>"Weren't you hungry?" his mother asked, but he
shook his head.</p>

<p>"One isn't hungry when the <i lang="fr">copain</i> (pal) on the
right is blown to atoms, and the <i lang="fr">copain</i> on the left is
bleeding to death." Then followed casualty details
that filled us with horror.</p>

<p>"I saw men go mad up there. They dashed their
brains out against walls, they shot themselves. Oh, it
was just hell! The shells fell so thick you could
hardly put a franc between them&mdash;thousands in an
hour. The French lost heavily, but the Germans....
I tell you, Mademoiselle, I have seen them climbing
over a wall of their own dead that high"&mdash;he touched
his breast&mdash;"to get at us. They came on in close
formation, drunk with ether. Oh, yes, it is quite
true, we could smell the ether in the French trenches.
I have seen the first lines throw away their rifles and
link arms as they staggered to attack. Oh, we <i lang="fr">fauché'd</i>
them! But for me, I like the bayonet, you drive it
in, you twist it round"&mdash;he made an expressive noise
impossible to reproduce&mdash;"they are afraid of the
bayonet, the Boches. Ah, it is fine...."</p>

<p>He is the only man I have ever spoken to who told
me he wanted to go back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Day after day we watched breathlessly for the
<i lang="fr">communiqués</i>; evening after evening we went to the
market hoping for better news, but there was no lifting
as yet in the storm-cloud that hung above the horizon.
And still the refugees poured through. We spent the
greater part of each day at the market now, snatching
meals at odd hours, and turning our hands to anything.
We swept floors, we stuffed palliasses with straw&mdash;but
we don't recommend this as a parlour game&mdash;we
helped to serve meals, we washed never-diminishing
piles of plates and bowls, forks and knives, we put
old ladies to bed, we made cups of chocolate for them
when they were unable to tackle the <i lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i>, we
chopped mountains of bread and cheese (our hands
were like charwomen's), we distributed chocolate and
"scarlet stew"&mdash;both gifts from the American Relief
Committee&mdash;we sorted the sheep from the goats at
night and&mdash;the <i lang="fr">garde</i> apart&mdash;kept the new dormitory
select. We became expert in cutting up enormous
joints of meat, our implements a short-handled knife
invariably coated with grease, a fork when we could
get one, and a small wooden board. So expert, indeed,
that one day a woman hovered round as we sliced and
cut and hacked, watching us intently for some minutes.
Then, "Are you a butcher?" she asked. It was an
equivocal compliment, but well meant. You see, she
was a butcher herself, and I suppose it would have
comforted her to talk to one of the fraternity.</p>

<p>And as we slice the turmoil rises round us. A woman
sits down to table and bursts into violent uncontrolled
weeping; a poor old creature wanders forlornly about,
finally making her way past the counter to the boiler
where the soup is bubbling. What does she want?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
"To put some wood on the fire. She is cold, and where
is her chair? Some one has taken it away." Her
brain has given way under the strain of the last five
days and she thinks she is at home. Snatches of
conversation float above the din. "It is three days
since I have touched hot food." "We slept in the
fields last night." "Mais abandonner tout." Tears
follow this pathetic little phrase. A man and woman
together, both over eighty, white-haired and palsied,
stray up to the counter. They cannot eat, they want
so very little, just some wine. The woman's skirts
drip as she waits; she has fallen into a stream as she
fled from the bombardment. They are established in
a corner where they mutter and nod, gibberish mostly,
for the old man's wits are wandering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the table begins to rock, one end rises
convulsively from the ground, plates and dishes begin
to slide ominously. An earthquake? Only a great
brindled hound that some one tied to the table leg
when we were not watching. He lay down, slept
happily, smelled dinner, has risen to his majestic
height and a wreck is upon us. The table sways more
ominously, then Fate, in the shape of the pretty
Pre-Raphaelitish <i lang="fr">femme-de-ménage</i> of the market,
swoops down upon him and sends him yowling into
the crowd, through which he cuts a cataclysmal way.
Dogs materialise out of space, we are sometimes tempted
to believe. They live desperate lives, are under
everybody's feet, appear, and disappear meteor-wise,
leaving trails of oaths behind them. A small child
plants himself on the floor, and seizing one of these
itinerant quadrupeds, tries to make it eat its own tail.
The dog prefers to eat the child; a wild skirmish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
ensues, there are shrieks and yowls that rend the
heavens, then a covey of women kick the dog into
space, and snatching up the child, carry him to the inner
room, where they hold a parliament over him amid a
babel of tongues that puts biblical history to shame.</p>

<p>A soldier, mud-stained, down from the trenches,
comes to look for his wife; a tall girl in a black straw
cart-wheel hat, plentifully adorned with enormous
white daisies, flits here and there; a coarse, burly man
who has looked on the wine when it is red and who is
wearing a <i lang="fr">peau-de-bicque</i> (goat-skin coat), which I
regard with every suspicion, tries to thrust half-a-franc
into my hand. Then comes an alarm. The
refugees are not told of it, but thirty Taubes are said
to be approaching the town. The meal goes on a
little more breathlessly, and we carry soup and meat
wondering what will happen if the sickening crash
comes. But the French <i lang="fr">avions</i> chase the Germans
away.... Late that night I saw the half-witted old
woman asleep on the floor, sitting up, her back propped
against a child's body, her knees drawn up to her
mouth.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>"There are refugees at the Ferme du Popey too."</p>

<p>Surely there are refugees everywhere! The quarters
at the market have long since proved grotesquely
inadequate, for not even the "Serrez-vous, serrez-vous"
of the <i lang="fr">garde</i> could pack three people upon
floor space for one, so schoolrooms and barrack-rooms
were requisitioned elsewhere, and now even the
resources of the farm are being drawn upon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
procession of broken, despairing people seemed never-ending.
We met them in every street, trailing pitifully
through the mire, or leading farm wagons piled high
with household goods. Those at the farm had all
come down in carts, it was said, many being days on
the road, so, thinking we might be of use, we waded
out to find the extensive <i lang="fr">basse-cour</i> a scene of strange
confusion.</p>

<p>Soldiers in horizon-blue were cooking food in their
regimental kitchens for famished women and children,
others were watering horses at the pond; through the
archway at the end we could see yet others hanging
socks and underlinen upon the fence; beyond ran
the canal guarded by its sentinel trees. Wagons filled
the yard, men were shouting and talking, officials
moved busily here and there. We climbed a glorified
ladder to a long, low, straw-strewn loft which was
murkily dark, the windows unglazed, being covered
by coarse matting which flapped in the wind. Here
a number of women were lying or talking in subdued
groups while children scrambled restlessly about, the
squalor and misery being heartrending. They were
leaving immediately, there was nothing to be done,
so, having chatted with a few, we went away, telling
a harassed official that we were at his service if he had
need of us.</p>

<p>A day or two later this offer had strange fruit, for
a horde of excited people descended upon the Boulevard,
rang at our door, swarmed into the hall and
demanded sabots. Now it happened that a short
time before a case of sabots had been sent to us by the
American Relief Committee (always generous supporters,
supplying many a need)&mdash;a case so vast that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
both wings of our front door had to be opened to
admit it&mdash;so we were able to invite the horde to satisfy
its needs. Instantly the hall became a pandemonium.
They flung themselves upon the box, they snatched,
they grabbed, they chattered in high, shrill voices&mdash;Meusienne
women of the working-classes generally
talk in a strident scream&mdash;they tried on sabots, they
flung sabots back into the box; in short, they behaved
very much as people do behave when their cupidity
is aroused and their nervous systems exhausted by an
almost unendurable strain.</p>

<p>The commotion, rising in a steady crescendo, had
risen <em>forte</em>, <em>fortissimo</em>, when bo-o-om! thud! bo-o-om!
bombs began to fall on the town. The clamour in
the hall died away, sabots dropped from nerveless
fingers. Bo-o-om! The cellar? <i lang="fr">Où est-ce?</i> Some
one leads the way, and then, while clamour of another
kind seizes the skies, in the icy cellar the mob of half-distraught
creatures fall on their knees and chant the
Rosary.</p>

<p>As a mist is wiped from a mirror by the passage
over it of a cloth, angers, passions, greeds were wiped
from their eyes, their voices sank to a quiet murmur.
Like children they prayed, and the Holy Spirit brooded
for one brief moment over hearts that yearned to God.</p>

<p>Then the raid ended, silence fell on the town, but
round the sabot-box, like gulls that scream above a
shoal of fish, rapacity swooped and dived, and its
voice, sea-gull shrill, bit through the air.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">MORE STORM-WRACK</p>


<p>A small volume might be written about those days
at the Marché Couvert, about the war gossip that
circulated, the adventures that were related.</p>

<p>In spite of the terrific shelling of Verdun only one
civilian was reported to have been killed during that
first week, and she imprudently left her cellar. The
bombardment was methodical. Three minutes storm,
then three minutes calm, then three minutes storm
again. Then the pulse-beat lengthened: fifteen minutes
storm, fifteen minutes calm. A priest told Madame B.
that, stop-watch in hand, he was able to visit his people
during the whole of the time, diving in and out of
cellars with a regularity equalled only by that of the
Germans. Two women, on the other hand, ran about
their village <i lang="fr">comme des fous</i> for eight days, shells dropping
four to the minute, but no one was hurt, because
the inhabitants had all gone to their cellars. How
they themselves escaped they did not know. They
had no cellar, that was why they ran.</p>

<p>Another woman was in her kitchen when a shell
struck the house. Seeing that her sister was badly hurt
she ran out, ran all the way down the village street,
scoured the vicinity looking for a doctor, found one,
brought him back, and as she was about to help him
to dress her sister's wound, realised that her foot was
wet, and looking down saw that her boot was full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
blood. Not only had the shell, or a fragment of shell,
torn her thigh badly, but it had shattered her hand as
well. Only the thumb and index finger can be moved a
little now, the other fingers are bent and twisted,
without any power, the arm is shrivelled and cannot be
raised above her head.</p>

<p>This woman was one of several who were turned out
of the Civil Hospital one bitter afternoon when the wind
cut into our flesh and sharp hail stung our faces. No
doubt the hospital was full, no doubt a large number
of bed or stretcher cases had come in, but somehow
we could find no excuse for the thoughtlessness which
turned that pitiful band of ailing, crippled, or blinded
women into the dark streets to stumble and fumble
their way through a strange town and then face the
horror of the market. Some were frankly idiotic from
fright, strain and age-weakened intellect; all were
terrified, cold and suffering. One, very old, sat on the
ground talking rapidly to herself. "She is détraquée,"
they whispered, so she was tucked up on a palliasse,
covered with rugs and left to her mumbling, her
monotonous, wearying babble. Next morning our
nurse, going her rounds, found that the unfortunate
creature was not <i lang="fr">détraquée</i> but delirious, that her
temperature was high and both lungs congested. It
was just a question whether she would survive the
journey to Fains, where, in the Departmental Lunatic
Asylum, some wards had been set aside for the overflow
from the hospital.</p>

<p>One of our coterie, burning with what we admitted
was justifiable wrath, gave a hard-hearted official from
the Prefecture a Briton's opinion of the matter.</p>

<p>"It was inhuman to treat these women so. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of them were wandering in the streets for hours. Why
didn't you send them direct to Fains?"</p>

<p>"There was no conveyance, the hospital was full ..."
so he excused himself.</p>

<p>"But they cannot stay here," she thundered. "It
is utterly unfit. They need nursing, comfort, special
care."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there is always the Ornain," he replied,
with a gesture towards the river, and the Briton, unable
to determine whether a snub, a sarcasm, or an inhumanity
was intended, for the only time in our
knowledge of her was obliged to leave the field to
France.</p>

<p>But she was restored to her wonted good-humour
later on by an old lady who undressed placidly in the
new dormitory, peeling off one garment after another
because she "had not taken her clothes off for three
days and three nights," who then knelt placidly by her
bedside and said her prayers, asking, as she tucked
the blankets round her, at what time she would be
called in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Called!</span> In that Bedlam!</p>

<p>Most of them were "called" by the big steam whistle
at the factory long before the cocks began to crow.
Zeppelins, tired of inactivity, began to prowl at night.
One, as everybody knows, was brought down in flames
near Révigny&mdash;a shred of its envelope lies in my
writing-case, my only <i lang="fr">souvenir de la guerre</i>, unless a
leaflet dropped by a Taube counts as such&mdash;causing
great excitement among the boys in the hospital at
Sermaize. No sooner did they hear the guns and the
throb of its engines than with one accord they scrambled
from their beds and rushed to the verandah, where a
wise matron rolled them in blankets and allowed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to remain to "see the fun," a breach of discipline for
which she was amply rewarded when, seeing the flames
shoot up through the skies, the boys rose to their feet
and shrilled the "Marseillaise" to the night in their
clear, sweet trebles. A dramatic moment that! The
long, low wooden hospital a blur against the moonlit
field, behind and all around the woods, silent, dark,
clustering closely, purple in the half-light of the moon,
the boys' white faces, their shrill cheer, and through
the sky the wide fire of Death falling, to lie a mammoth
dragon on the whitened fields. It is said that there
was a woman in that Zeppelin&mdash;some fragments of
clothing, a slipper were found....</p>

<p>Another, more fortunate, dropped bombs at Révigny
and Contrisson, where by bad luck an ammunition
wagon was hit. One at least of the wagons caught fire,
but was quickly uncoupled by heroic souls who were
subsequently decorated. The first explosion shook
our windows in Bar-le-Duc, and then for two or more
hours we heard report after report as shell after shell
exploded. In the morning wild tales were abroad.
The main line to Paris had been cut, Trèmont (miles
in the other direction) had been bombed, numbers of
civilians had been killed and injured; Révigny was
in even smaller shreds than before; in short, Rumour,
that busy jade, was having a well-occupied morning.
But that is not unusual in the War Zone. She is rarely
idle there. The number of times we were told a
bombardment by long-range guns was signalled for
Bar is incalculable. The town passed from one <i lang="fr">crise
de nerfs</i> to another, some one was always in a panic
over a coming event which did not honour us even
by casting its shadow before.</p>

<p>The Zeppelins, to be quite frank, were a nuisance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
They never reached the town, which has reason to be
grateful for the narrowness of its valley and the protecting
height of its hills, but they made praiseworthy
attempts at all sorts of odd hours, and generally the
most inconvenient that could well be chosen. The
doings at Révigny and Contrisson warned us that a
visit might be fraught with disagreeable results, for
Bar is a concentrated place, it does not straggle, and
when raids occur practically every street is peppered.</p>

<p>So though we did not go to the cellars, we felt it
incumbent upon us to be ready to do so should necessity
arise, which probably explains why the syren invariably
blew when one or two shivering wretches were sitting
tailor-wise in rubber or canvas basins, fondly persuading
themselves that they were having a bath.</p>

<p>When there are twenty degrees of frost, when water
freezes where it falls on your uncarpeted bedroom floor,
bathing in a canvas basin has its drawbacks; but if, just
as your precious canful of hot water has been splashed
in and you "mit nodings on" prepare to get as close
to godliness as it is possible for erring mortal to do, the
syren's long, lugubrious note throbs on the air, well,
you float away from godliness fairly rapidly on the
wings of language that would have shocked the most
condemnatory Psalmist of them all. I really believe
those Zeppelins <span class="smcap">KNEW</span> when our bath-water boiled.
We went to bed at ten-thirty or we waited till midnight.
"Let's get the beastly thing over, it is such a
bore dressing again." We dodged in at odd hours of
the evening, it was just the same. Venus was always
surprised. In the end, and when in spite of nightly
and daily warnings, nothing happened, our faith in
French airmen became as the rock that moveth not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and is never dismayed. Though syrens hooted and
bugles blew, though the town guard turning out
marched under our windows, the unclothed soaped and
lathered and splashed with unemotional vigour, while
the clothed chastely wondered what would happen if
a bomb struck the house and Venus.... Oh, well,
the French rise magnificently to any situation.</p>

<p>Once I confess to rage. We had a visitor. We had
all worked hard all day at the market, we had come
home after ten, and, wearied out, had tucked ourselves
into bed, aching in every limb. The visitor and the
smallest member of the coterie returned even later.
Slumber had just sealed my eyelids when a voice
said in my ear, "Miss Day, I'm so sorry, there's a
Zeppelin." Just as though it were sitting on the roof,
you know, preparing to lay an egg.</p>

<p>"Call me when the bombs begin to fall." Slumber
seized me once more. Again the voice. "I think you
must get up; Visitor says it is not safe."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to&mdash;the Common-room."</p>

<p>It was no use. I was dragged out. There are
moments when one could cheerfully boil one's fellow-creatures
in a sausage-pot.</p>

<p>At the market when danger threatened every one
was ruthlessly hunted to the cellar. And French cellars
are the coldest things on earth. Even on the hottest
day in summer they are cool, in the winter they would
freeze a polar bear. Indeed, we were sometimes
tempted to declare that the cellars did more harm than
Zeppelin or Taube.</p>

<p>Air-raids affect different people differently. One
woman said they&mdash;well, she said, "Ça fait sauter (to
jump) l'estomac," which must have been sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
disagreeable; another declared, "Ça fait trop de bile."
Nearly all developed nerve troubles, and Madame
Phillipot&mdash;who succeeded Madame Drouet as our
<i lang="fr">femme de ménage</i>, refused to undress at night. In
vain we reasoned with her. She slept armed <i lang="fr">cap-à-pie</i>,
ready for immediate flight, and not until a slight indisposition
gave us a weapon, which we used with
unscrupulous skill and energy, did we wring from her a
promise to go to bed like a respectable Christian.
Madame Albert died trembling in the darkness one
night: an old woman, affected by bronchial trouble,
flying from Death, found him in the icy cellar; many
a case of bronchitis and lung trouble was reported as
an outcome of these nightly raids, children especially
began to suffer, their nerves breaking down, their little
faces becoming pinched, dark shadows lying under
their eyes.</p>

<p>In the War Zone people don't write letters to the
Press discussing the advisability of taking refuge in a
raid, nor do they talk of "women and children cowering
in cellars." No one suggests that the well-to-do
"should set an example or show the German they are
not afraid." France is too logical for nonsense of that
kind. It knows that soldiers do not sit on the parapet
of a trench when strafing is going on&mdash;it would call
them harsh names if they did, and so would we. It
believes in reasonable precautions. After all, the
German object is to kill as many civilians as possible&mdash;why
gratify him by running up the casualty rate?
Why occupy ambulances that might be put to better
use? Why occupy the time of doctors and nurses who
are more urgently wanted in the military wards? Why
put your relatives to the expense of a funeral? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
indeed? Why court suicide for the sake of a stupid
sentiment? Logic echoes why? Logic goes calmly to
its cellar or to that of its neighbour, if it happens to be
out and away from its own when trouble begins.
Logic comes up again and goes serenely about its
business when trouble is over.</p>

<p>Only the nerve-wrecks, people who have sustained
long bombardment by shell-fire for the most part,
really lose presence of mind. And for them there is
every excuse. Let no one who has not suffered as they
have presume to judge them.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;it was downright wicked, I admit&mdash;two of
us, both, be it confessed, wild Irishwomen, with all the
native and national love of a row boiling in our veins,
hearing the syren one evening, somewhere about nine
o'clock, put on our hats and coats, and kilting our
skirts, set off up the hill. We left consternation behind
us, but then we did so want to see a Zeppelin!</p>

<p>The valley was bathed in soft fitful light. The moon
was almost full, but misty clouds flitted across the sky,
fugitives flying before a wooing wind. Below us the
town lay in darkness. Not a lamp showing. About
us rose the old town, the rue Chavé looming cliff-like
high above our heads. We pressed on, pierced the
shadows of that narrow street and gained the rue des
Grangettes, there to be met with a sight so weird, so
suggestive of tragedy I wish I could have painted it.
From the tall, grim houses men and women had poured
out. Children sat huddled beside them, others slept
in their mother's arms. On the ground lay bags and
bundles. Whispers hissed on the air. It was alive
with sibilant sound. No one talked aloud. They were
as people that watch in an ante-room when Death has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
touched one who relinquishes life reluctantly in a room
beyond. In the rue Tribel were more groups. In the
rue des Ducs de Bar still more. We thought the
population of those old ghost-haunted houses must all
have come forth from a shelter in which they no longer
trusted. A Zeppelin bomb, it is said, will crash through
six storeys and break the roof of the cellar beneath.
Here in the street there was no safety. But in the
woods beyond the town, in the woods high on the hill....
Many and many a poor family spent long night
hours in the cold, the wet and the storm, their little
all gathered in bundles beside them during those intense
months of early spring. We felt&mdash;or at least I know
that I felt&mdash;as we walked through this world of
whispering shadow, utterly unreal. I ceased to believe
in Zeppelins; earth, material things slid away,
in the cloud-veiled moonlight values became distorted;
I felt like a spectator at a play, but a play where
only shadows act behind a dim, semi-transparent
screen.</p>

<p>Then we came to the Place Tribel, and the world
enclosed us again. A soldier with a telescope swept
the heavens, others gazed anxiously out over the hills
towards St Mihiel. The night was very still and beautiful;
strange that out there, somewhere in the void,
Death should be riding, coming perhaps near to our
own souls, with his message written already upon
our hearts. In the streets below a bugle call rang out
clear and sweet, the <i lang="fr">Alerte</i>, the danger signal.... We
thought of the hurried wretches making their way to
the woods.... Odd that one should want to see a
Zeppelin!</p>

</div>
<p class="center">AIR RAIDS</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Where the grey gas-bags failed, Taubes often succeeded.
At first they came "in single spies," but later
"in battalions." And after one of the early and abortive
raids which did no damage&mdash;a mere bagatelle of three
bombs and one soldier with a cut over his eye&mdash;posters
of such exquisite import were plastered over the walls
that I must tell you about them.</p>

<p>They emanated from the Mayor, kind father to his
people, who told us&mdash;we thrilled to hear it&mdash;"that in
these tragic hours&mdash;of war&mdash;we had known how to meet
the dangers that menaced us with unfailing calmness
and courage" (I translate literally), and that "our
presence of mind in the face of such sterile manifestations
would always direct our moral force." Very
flattering. We preened feathers quite unjustifiably,
since admittedly the occasion had called for no emotion
save that of a limited, feminine, and quite reasonable
curiosity.</p>

<p>Then, still glowing, we read on. Mayoral praise is
sweet, but mayoral instructions hard to follow. The
wisest course to pursue when hostile aviators aviate is,
it seems, to take refuge in the nearest house and not to
gaze at the sky&mdash;surely that Mayor had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
born of woman!&mdash;or, should there be no house, "to
distance oneself rapidly and laterally."</p>

<p>We ceased to glow. We remembered we were but
dust. Distance oneself laterally? Good, but suppose
one was walking by the Canal? With an impenetrable
hedge on one side, were we to spring to the other?
I have seen the Canal in all its moods. I have never
felt the smallest desire to bathe in it. I have still less
desire to drown&mdash;suffocate!&mdash;in it. And if one doesn't
know in which direction the bomb is going to fall?...
How be lateral and rapid before it arrives? Suppose
one jumped right under it? Suppose one waits till it
comes? "Too late. Too late; ye cannot <em>distance</em>
now."</p>

<p>Some one suggests that we ought to practise being
rapid and lateral. "My dear woman, I don't know
what being lateral means." Thus the unenlightened
of the party.</p>

<p>"Study the habits of that which can be lateral to
all points of the compass at once when you try to catch
it," was the frivolous reply. Well, opportunities were
not wanting. We decided to take lessons. And then
promptly forgot all about Taubes. That is one of the
unintentional blessings incidental to their career.
When they are not showering bombs on you, you eliminate
them from consciousness. Perhaps, in spite of all
the damage they have done, they are still too new, too
unnatural to be accepted. A raid is just an evil nightmare&mdash;for
those who suffer no bodily harm. It brings
you as a nightmare does to the very edge of some
desperate enterprise; you feel the cold, awful fear; you
are held in the grip of some deadly unimagined thing
that holds you, forces you down, something you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
see, something you do not understand, but that you
know is hideous, terrible in its happening. The noise
breaks on your brain, the noise that is only the symptom
of the ill.... Then silence shuts down ... and you
awake....</p>

<p>Once, at least for us, the awakening was a tragic
one. Ascension Day. A clear, warm summer sky,
windless, perfect. Dinner just over in the town.
Shops opening again. Life stirring in the streets.
An ideal moment for those who are quick to take
advantage of such. There was no signal to warn us of
what was coming, no time for pedestrians to distance
themselves laterally or otherwise. Death found them
as they walked through the streets, or gossiped in the
station yard. The Place de la Gare became a shambles.
Women&mdash;why dilate on the horror? Forty people
were killed outright, over a hundred were wounded,
and of these many subsequently died. In our cellar
we listened to the storm, then when it was over we went
through the town seeking out our people, anxious to
help. We saw horses, mangled and bleeding, lying on
the quay-side, a tree riven near the Pont Nôtre Dame,
blood flowing in the gutters, telegraph wires lying in
grotesque loops and coils on the roadway or hanging
in festoons from the façades of houses. (An underground
wire was laid down after this.) Glass&mdash;we
walked on a carpet of glass, and in the houses we saw
things that "God nor man ever should look upon."</p>

<p>Saw too, then and in subsequent raids, how Death,
if he has marked you for his own, will claim you even
though you hide, even though you seek the "safe"
shelter you trust in so implicitly, but which plays the
traitor and opens the gate to the Enemy who knocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Madame Albert; the old sick woman. Now the eldest
Savard girl, a tall, graceful, handsome creature, just
twenty years of age. With a number of others including
her mother, younger sister, and several soldiers
(oh, yes, soldiers "cower" too, and are not always the
last to dive to shelter), she fled to the nearest cellar
when the raid began, but the entrance was not properly
closed, and when a bomb burst in the yard outside,
splinters killed five of the soldiers, and wounded her so
cruelly she died that night.</p>

<p>Then there was Madame Bertrand, pursued by a
malignant spirit of evil. Twice a refugee, she came to
Bar in February, drifting from the market to the Maison
Blanpain, where within six weeks of her arrival two
of her three children had died. (Her husband was a
soldier, of course.) One contracted diphtheria, the
other was struck down by some virulent and never-diagnosed
complaint which lasted just twenty-four
hours. Expecting shortly to become a mother again,
Madame was standing at her house door that sunny
June day when a bomb fell in the street. She was
killed instantly.</p>

<p>A fortnight later the little boy who brought parcels
from the <i lang="fr">épicerie</i> died. He, like Mademoiselle Savard,
was in a cellar, but a fragment of shell came through
the tiny <i lang="fr">soupirail</i> (ventilation grating)....</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>In June, the town looked as if it were preparing
for a siege. The stage direction, "Excursions and
alarums," was interpolated extravagantly over all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
drama of our life. If we had been rabbits we might
have enjoyed it, there being something slightly facetious,
not to say hilarious, in the flirt of the white bob as it
scurries to cover, but as actors in the said drama we
soon ceased to find it amusing. It interfered so confoundedly
with our work! Worst of all, it unsettled
our people.</p>

<p>The sang-froid of some of the shopkeepers, however,
was magnificent. They simply put their shutters up,
pinned a label on the door and went south or west,
to wait till the <i lang="fr">rafale</i> blew over. Before going, Monsieur
was always at pains to inform us that he, for his part,
was indifferent, but Madame, alas, Madame! Nerves....
An eloquent shrug that in no way dimmed the
brilliance of Madame's smile as she gazed at us from
behind his unconscious back. We, for our part,
blushed for our sex. Then he asked us if we, too, had
not fear? Saying no, we felt unaccountably bombastic.
We read braggart in his eye, we scarcely dared to hope
he would not read <i lang="fr">froussard</i> in ours. Politely he hoped
that when he returned our valuable custom would
again be his? Reassured, he stretched a more or less
grimy hand over the counter, we laid ours upon it,
suspicions vanished! With the word <i lang="fr">devouée</i> gleaming
like a halo round our unworthy heads, we stepped
again into the street, there to admire a vista of shutters.</p>

<p>(It may be of interest to psychologists that shopkeepers
without wives, and shopkeepers without
husbands, generally elected to remain in the town.
They kept, however, their shutters down. Monsieur X.,
running out to close his during a raid, was blown to
atoms. One learns wisdom&mdash;by experience&mdash;in the
War Zone.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Stepped out to admire, too, a fantastic collection of
boxes and bags ranged close against the walls at
irregular intervals. Since the affair of the <i lang="fr">soupirail</i>
gratings were no longer left unguarded. Tiny though
they were, almost unnoticeable specks just where the
house wall touched the pavement, they could be dangerous.
Consequently, bags of sand, boxes of sand, and
big rockery stones were propped against them to be a
snare to the unwary at night, and, as the hot summer
sped by, to testify (as our shy member cogently remarked)
to the visiting proclivities of the dogs of the
town. The bags burst, they added to that composite
Ess Bouquet that rose so penetratingly in warm
weather, but the sand and the stones remained. In
the winter, snow buried them. Then the snow froze.
Coming round the corner of the Rue Lapique one dark
Laplandish night, I trod on the edge of a heap of
frozen snow.... There are six hundred and seventy-three
ways of falling on frozen snow, and I practised
most of them that winter, but, as an accomplishment,
am bound to admit that they seem to be devoid of
any artistic merit whatever.</p>

<p>Following the sandbags came <i lang="fr">affiches</i>. Every
cellared house&mdash;and nearly every house had its cellar&mdash;blazed
the information abroad. "Cave voutée"
(vaulted cellar), 20 <i lang="fr">personnes</i>, 50 <i lang="fr">personnes</i>, 200 <i lang="fr">personnes</i>,
even 500 <i lang="fr">personnes</i>, indicated shelter in an
emergency. In a raid every man's cellar is his neighbour's.
Once we harboured some refugees, and that
night at dinner the shy member (perhaps I ought to
say that the adjective was entirely self-bestowed),
gurgled suddenly. We looked at her expectantly.</p>

<p>"I was only thinking that Miss &mdash;&mdash; (No. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
not betray her!) is not supposed to smoke when the
refugees are about, but in the middle of the raid she
came swanking down to the cellar to-day with a
cigarette in her mouth."</p>

<p>As one not unremotely connected with the incident
I take leave to disqualify "swank." Professional
smokers never swank, it is the attribute of the mere
amateur.</p>

<p>So many precautions were taken, it would seem that
any one who got hurt during a raid had only himself
to blame, and for those who may think warnings
superfluous, I may add that never again was the
casualty list as high as on that unwarned Ascension
Day. Indeed, in subsequent raids&mdash;while I was in
Bar, at least&mdash;it decreased in the most arresting manner.
True, the day and night were rendered hideous with
noise. To the <i lang="fr">sirène</i> was added the steam-whistle at the
gas-works, but these being deemed insufficient, a
loud tocsin clanged from the old Horloge on the hill.
I have known people to sleep through them all, but
their names will never be divulged by so discreet a
historian.</p>

<p>Though the danger was lessened, the nerve-strain
unfortunately remained. Mothers with children found
life intolerable. It was bad enough to spend one's
days like a Jack-in-the-box jumping in and out of the
cellar, but infinitely worse to spend the night doing it.
Flight was&mdash;I was going to say in the air! It was at
least on many lips. People were poised, as it were,
hesitant, unwilling to haul up anchor, afraid to face
out upon the unknown sea, yet still more afraid to
remain. Then, as I have told you, eight warnings and
two raids in twenty-four hours robbed over-taxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
nerves of their last ounce of endurance. The Prefecture
was besieged, and in one day alone three hundred
people left the town. Those who had friends or
relatives in other districts were, as is usual in all such
cases, allowed to join them, others were herded like
sheep, and like sheep were driven where shepherd and
sheep-dog willed. Nearly all the Basket-makers fled.
The Maison Blanpain turned its unsavoury contents
out of doors. Many of our fastest and firmest friends
came to say good-bye with tears in their eyes; it was
a heartrending time, and one which, if continued, would
have seen an end to all our labour. This fear was
happily not realised, for as fast as one lot of refugees
went away another lot drifted in, and the following
winter was the busiest we were to know.</p>

<p>To all who came to say good-bye, clothes were given,
and especially boots, America having come again to
our rescue with some consignments which, if they added
to our grey hairs&mdash;I would "rather be a dog and bay
the moon" than assistant in a boot-shop&mdash;added in
far larger measure to the contentment and happiness
of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Boots were, and no doubt still are, almost unobtainable
luxuries, for those who try to make both ends of
an <em>allocation</em> meet. As a garment, it may be said that
the allocation (I change my metaphor, you notice) just
falls below the waist-line, it never reaches down to the
feet. How could it when even a child's pair of shoes cost
as much as twelve francs? and are <i lang="fr">du papier</i> at that.</p>

<p>Our boot-shop was a dark, damp, refrigerating closet
at the end of the hall where boots of all sizes were of
necessity piled, or slung over lines that stretched
across the room. What you needed was never on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
line. But the line's adornments beat you about the
head as you stooped to burrow in the heaps underneath.</p>

<p>To add to your enjoyment of the situation, you
were aware that the difference between French feet
and American feet is as wide as the Atlantic that
rolls between.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, those that came were shod. I personally
can take no credit for it. My plunges into the
refrigerator only served as a rule to send the temperature
up! The miracles of compression and expansion
were performed by the Directrice of the establishment,
who will, I hope, forgive me if I say that I deplore an
excellent sportswoman lost in her. She had the divine
instinct of the chase, and when she ran her quarry to
earth her eyes bubbled. At other times, she tried to
hide the softest heart that ever betrayed a woman under
a grim exterior, that only deceived those who saw no
further than her protecting pince-nez.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>Yes, they were going. Old friends of over a year's
standing, many of whom we had visited again and again,
and of whom we shall carry glad memories till the final
exodus of all carries us beyond the Eternal Shadows.
Madame Drouet, our <i lang="fr">femme de ménage</i>, was wavering;
pressure, steadily applied, was slowly driving her to the
thing she dreaded and disliked. Then, as you know,
the blow fell.</p>

<p>She was gone, and we gazed at one another in consternation.
Where would we find such another?
Hastily we ran over a list of names, and then, Eureka!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
we had it. Madame Phillipot, of course. On with our
hats, and hot foot at top speed to the rue de Véel.
An agitated half-hour&mdash;Madame was diffident, she
was no cook, she could never please Les Anglaises&mdash;a
triumphant return, all her scruples overruled, and the
inauguration of a reign of peace and plenty such as we
shall not see again. There is only one Madame Phillipot
in this grey old world. Only one, and we loved her.
Loved her? Why, we could not help it! Picture a
little robin-redbreast of a woman, short and plump,
with pretty dark eyes and clear skin, and the chirpiest
voice that ever made music on a summer day. I can
hear her now lilting her "Bon Soir, Mesdemoiselles,"
as she came to bid us good-night. The little ceremony
was never forgotten, nor was the morning greeting.
She rarely talked, she chirped, and she chirped the
long day through. The coming of every new face was
an adventure. No longer did the uninterested "C'est
une dame," hurl us from our peace. No. In five
minutes, in five seconds Madame, interviewing the
new-comer, had grasped all the salient points of her
history, and we went forth armed, ready to smite or
succour as occasion demanded. And dearly she loved
her bit of gossip. What greetings the old stone staircase
witnessed! What ah's and oh's of delight!
We would hear the voluble tide rising, rising, and groan
over rooms undusted, and beds blushing naked at
midday. But it was impossible to be angry with
Madame. The work was done sooner or later, generally
later, and when we sat down to her <i lang="fr">ragoût</i>, or her
<i lang="fr">bœuf mode</i>, or her <i lang="fr">blanquette de veau</i> in the evening
her sins put on the wings of virtue and fluttered, silver
plumed, to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, I am a mild woman, but there are hours in
which I yearn to murder M. Phillipot, and Pappa,
and Mademoiselle Clémence, for they hold Madame to
the soil of France. If she was a widowed orphan,
perhaps we might console our lonely old age together,
but no one could be really lonely when Madame was by.
Is one lonely in woods when birds are singing?</p>

<p>It was the ambition of her life to be a milliner, but
Pappa&mdash;you shall hear about him presently&mdash;said No.
So she married M. Phillipot instead, and became the
wife of a <i lang="fr">commis-voyageur</i> who did not deserve to get
her. For he had as mother an old harridan who
insisted on living with him, and who, bitterly jealous of
Madame, made her life a burden to her. The <i lang="fr">commis-voyageur</i>
having a soul like his bag of samples, all bits
and scraps, always sided with his mother.</p>

<p>Once Madame asked me to guess her age. I hazarded
thirty-eight quite honestly, and she flushed like a
girl. "Ah, mais non. She was older than that. She
was...." (I shan't "give her away." Am not
I, too, a woman?)</p>

<p>"You don't look it, Madame," I answered truthfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, but if only Mademoiselle had seen me before
the war. When I was dressed in my pretty Sunday
clothes. Ah, que j'étais belle! And fresh and young.
One would have given me thirty."</p>

<p>Her speech was the most picturesque thing, a source
of unfailing delight. Once in that awful frost, when
for six weeks there was ice on the bedroom floor and a
phylactery of ice adorned my sponge-bag, when the
moisture that exuded from the walls became <i lang="fr">crystallisé</i>,
and neither blankets, nor fur coat, nor hot water
bottle kept one warm at night, Madame, seeing me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
huddle a miserable half-dead thing over the stove, cried,
"It is under a <i lang="fr">cloche</i> we should put you, Mademoiselle
Day." And the three villains who shared my misery
with ten times my fortitude chuckled with delight.
My five-foot seven and ample proportions being
"forced" like a salad under the bell-glass of intensive
culture! No wonder we laughed. But I longed for
the <i lang="fr">cloche</i> all the same.</p>

<p>As for her good humour it was indestructible. When
people came, as people inconsiderately will come,
from other work-centres demanding food at impossible
hours, Madame sympathised with the agonies of the
housekeeper and evolved meals out of nothingness,
out of a leek and a lump of butter, or out of three sticks
of macaroni, one <i lang="fr">gousse d'ail</i> and a pinch of salt.
The clove of garlic went into every pot&mdash;was it that
which made her dishes so savoury? When the gas was
shut off at five o'clock just as dinner was under way,
she didn't tear her hair and blaspheme her gods; she
cooked. Don't ask me how she did it. I can only
state the fact. On two gas-rings, with a tiny hot-plate
in between, she cooked a soup, a meat dish, two
vegetables and a pudding every night, and served them
all piping hot whether the gas "marched" or whether
it did not.</p>

<p>If we wanted to send her into the seventh heaven we
gave her a "commission" in the town, or asked her
to trim a hat. We would meet her trotting up the
Boulevard, her basket on her arm, her smile irradiating
the greyest day, and know that when she returned
every rumour&mdash;and Bar seethed with rumours&mdash;every
scrap of gossip&mdash;it was a hotbed of gossip&mdash;on the wing
that day would be ours for the asking. She never held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
herself aloof as Madame Drouet did. She became one
of the household, and it would have done your heart
good to see her on Sunday morning trotting (she always
trotted) first from one room and then to another with
trays of coffee and rolls, keeping us like naughty children
in bed, ostensibly because we must be tired, we
worked so hard (O Madame! Madame!), but actually
we believed to keep us out of the way while she
scuttled through her work in time for Mass.</p>

<p>Her dusting was even sketchier than Madame
Drouet's, and when she washed out a room she always
left one corner dry, but whether in pursuance of a
sacred rite or as a concession to temperament, I cannot
say.</p>

<p>Meantime she lived in one room in the rue de Véel,
sharing it with her father and Mademoiselle Clémence.
M. Phillipot, his existence once acknowledged, faded
more and more surely from our ken. He was not in
Bar-le-Duc, he was in a misty, nebulous somewhere
with his virago of a mother. We felt that wherever
he was he deserved it, and speedily put him out of our
existence. But he occurred later. Husbands do, it
seems, in France.</p>

<p>Frankly, I believe that Madame forgot him too.
She never spoke of him, and she was devoted to M.
Godard and Clémence, who are of the stock and breeding
that keep one's faith in humanity alive. Monsieur
was a carpenter, an old retainer of the château near
his home. A well-to-do man, we gathered, of some
education and magnificent spirit. When the Germans
captured his village they seized him, buffeted him
and threatened to shoot him. Well, he just defied them.
Flung back his old head and dared them to do their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
worst. Even when he was kneeling in the village square
waiting the order to fire he defied them. He told
me the story more than once, but the details escaped
me. Heaven having deprived him of teeth, he had a
quaint trick of substituting nails, with his mouth
full of which he waxed eloquent. Now, toothless
French causes the foreigner to pour ashes on her
head and squirm in the very dust, but French garnished
with "des points" ...!</p>

<p>Of course I ought to have mastered it, as opportunities
were not lacking, but Monsieur, who worked
regularly for us, was unhappily slightly deaf. So what
with the difficulty of making him understand me, and
the difficulty of making me understand him, our
intimacy, though at all times of the most affectionate
nature, rested rather on goodwill than on soul to soul
intercourse.</p>

<p>A scheme for providing the refugees with chests in
which to keep their scanty belongings having been
set afoot, Monsieur was established in the wood-shed
with planes, hammer and nails, and there he became a
fixture. We simply could not get on without him.
We flew to him in every crisis, flying back occasionally
in laughter and indignation, with the storm of his
disapproval still whistling in our ears. He could be
as obstinate as a mule, and oh, how he could chasten
us for our good! In the intervals he made chests out
of packing-cases, which he adorned with hinges and a
loop for a padlock, while we painted the owner's
initials in heavy lettering on the top. So highly
were they prized and sought after, our stock of packing-cases
ran out, and those who wanted them had to bring
their own. It was then that Monsieur's gift of invec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>tive
showed itself in all its razor-like keenness. For,
grievous to relate, there are people in the world who
presume upon generosity&mdash;mean people who will not
play the game. Every packing-case in process of
transformation made serious inroads on Monsieur's
time, and upon the small supply of wood at his disposal,
so their cost was not small. But if you had
seen some of the boxes brought to our door!</p>

<p>"That?" Monsieur wagged a contemptuous finger
at the overgrown match-box one despicable creature
planted under his enraged eyes. "That? A chest to
hold linen? Take it away. It will do to carry your
prayer book in when you go to Mass."</p>

<p>Or, "It is a chest that you want me to make out
of that? That? Look at it. C'est du papier à
cigarette. Your husband can roll his tobacco in it."</p>

<p>We chuckled as we blessed him. No doubt we
were often imposed upon, and Monsieur had an eye
like a needle for the impostor.</p>

<p>In process of manufacture, marks of ownership
sometimes became erased, and then there was woe in
Israel.</p>

<p>"That my caisse? Mais je vous assure Mademoiselle
the caisse that I brought was large, grande comme
ça"&mdash;a gesture suggested a mausoleum. "Yes, and I
wrote my name on it with the pencil of Monsieur,
there, dans le couloir. He saw me write it, Vannier-Lefeuvre.
Monsieur will testify."</p>

<p>We gazed at Monsieur. "Vannier-Lefeuvre? Bon.
Regardez la liste. C'est le numero twenty-two."</p>

<p>"But there is NO number twenty-two, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Eh bien, il faut chercher."</p>

<p>This to a demented philanthropist who had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
wasted a good hour in the search. (The hall was piled
ceiling high with the wretched cases, you know.)
Madame Vannier-Lefeuvre lifted up a strident voice
and sang in minor key a dirge in memory of the lost
treasure. Its size, its beauty, its strength, the twenty-five
sous she had paid for it at the <i lang="fr">épicerie</i>.... No,
it was not that, nor that. We dragged out the best,
even some special treasures bigger and better than
anything she could have produced. All in vain.
"Monsieur." We appealed to Cæsar.</p>

<p>Boom, bang, boom. With his mouth full of nails,
humming a stifled song, Cæsar drove a huge nail into
the case of Madame Poiret-Blanc. Five minutes later
Madame Lefeuvre-Vannier&mdash;"or Vannier-Lefeuvre ça
ne fait rien," marched off with our finest <i lang="fr">caisse</i> on her
<i lang="fr">brouette</i>, woe on her wily old face and devilish glee in
her heart. And we, turning to pulverise Monsieur,
whose business it was to mark every case in order to
prevent confusion, found ourselves dumb. We might
rage in the Common-room, but in the wood-shed we
were as lambs that baa'ed.</p>

<p>And we forgave him all his sins the day he, with a
look of ineffable dignity just sufficiently tinged with
contempt, brushed aside a huge gendarme at the
station. Some one was going away, and Monsieur
had wheeled her luggage over on the <i lang="fr">brouette</i>.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to go on the platform." Thus the
arm of military law, an <i lang="fr">Avis</i> threatening pains and
penalties hanging over his head.</p>

<p>"Forbidden? Do you not know that I am the valet
de ces dames?"</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a gendarme crumple?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p>Twenty degrees, twenty-two degrees, twenty-five
degrees of frost. A clear blue sky, brilliant sunshine,
a snow-bound world.</p>

<p>"Pas chaud," people would declare as they came
shivering into our room. Not hot! Are the French
never positive? I think only when it rains, and then
they do commit themselves to a "quel vilain temps."</p>

<p>The ice on the windows, even at the sunny side of
the house, refused to thaw; the water pipes froze. Not
a drop of water in the house, everything solid. Madame
put a little coke stove under the tap, and King Frost
laughed aloud. The tap thawed languidly, then froze
again, and remained frozen. A week, two, three weeks
went by. Happily there was water in the cellar.</p>

<p>It was <i lang="fr">ennuyant</i>, certainly, to be obliged to fetch all
the water in pails across the small garden, through the
hall and up the stairs, but Madame endured it, as she
endured the chilblains that tortured her feet, and the
nipping cold of her kitchen. Even the frost could
not harden her bubbling good humour.</p>

<p>King Frost gripped the world in firmer fingers, the
sun grew more brilliant, the sky more blue. The Canal
froze, the lock gates were ice palaces, the streets and
roads invitations to death or permanent disablement.
Still Madame endured. A morning came when the
cold stripped the flesh from our bones, and we shook as
with an ague. The Common-room door opened,
desolation was upon us. Madame staggered in, fell
upon a chair and, lifting up her voice, wept aloud.
She was <i lang="fr">désolée</i>. For two hours she had laboured in
the cellar, she had lighted the <i lang="fr">réchaud</i> (the little stove),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
she had poured boiling water over the tap, she had
prayed, she had invoked the Saints and Pappa, but
the water would not come. <i lang="fr">Pas une goutte!</i> And
every pipe in the Quartier was frozen, there was no
water left in all the ice-bound world.</p>

<p>Madame in tears! Madame in a <i lang="fr">crise de nerfs</i>!
She who had coped with disasters that left us gibbering
imbeciles, and had laughed her way through vicissitudes
that reduced me, at least, to the intelligent level
of a nerveless jelly-fish! We nearly had a <i lang="fr">crise de
nerfs</i> ourselves, but happily some hot tea was forthcoming,
hot tea which in France is not a beverage, but
an <i lang="fr">infusion</i>&mdash;like <i lang="fr">tilleul</i>, you know&mdash;and with that
we pulled ourselves together. We also resuscitated
Madame, whose long vigil in the cellar had frozen her
as nearly solid as the pipes. Later on, she complained
of feeling ill, <i lang="fr">un peu souffrante</i>. Asked to describe her
symptoms, she said she had "l'estomac embarrassé."
Before so mysterious a disease we wilted. But the loan
of a huge <i lang="fr">marmite</i> from the Canteen restored her; there
was water in the deep well in the Park, Pappa would
take the <i lang="fr">marmite</i> on the <i lang="fr">brouette</i> and bring back supplies
for the house. He brought them. As the <i lang="fr">marmite</i>
made its heavy way up the stairs, some one asked where
the queer smell came from.</p>

<p>"That? It is from the water," he replied simply.</p>

<p>Sanitary authorities, take note. We survived it.
And we kept ourselves as clean as we could. When
we couldn't we consoled ourselves by remembering
that the washed are less warm than the unwashed.
M. l'Abbé told me that he dropped baths out of his
scheme of things while the frost lasted. Were we not
afraid to bathe? We confessed to a reasonable fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of being found one morning sitting in my square of
green canvas, a pillar like Lot's wife, but of ice, not
salt. He brooded on the picture I called up, I slid
like a bag of coal down the hill.</p>

<p>Having administered comfort to "l'estomac embarrassé,"
we rationed our supply of water, we prayed for
a thaw, Madame began to chirp again, the world was
not altogether given over to the devil. But peace
had forsaken our borders. Going into the kitchen one
morning I found Madame in tears. M. Phillipot had
occurred. The deluge was upon us.</p>

<p>Wearying of life in the South, he had come back to
Révigny, his mother, of course, as always, upon his
arm, and there, possessed of a thousand devils, he had
bought a wooden house, and there his mother, with
all the maddening malice of a perverse, inconsiderate
animal, had been seized with an illness and was
preparing to die.</p>

<p>And she had sent for Madame. No wonder the
heavens fell.</p>

<p>"All my life she has ill-treated me," the poor little
woman sobbed, "and now when I am si heureuse avec
vous, when I earn good money, she sends for me.
Quel malheur! What cruelty! You do not know
what a rude enfer (hell) I have suffered with that
woman. And chez nous, one was so happy. With
Pappa and Clémence all was so peaceful, never a cross
word, never a temper. Ah, what sufferings! Did
not the contemplation of them turn Clémence from
marriage for ever? Because of my so grande misère
never would she marry. La belle-mère, she hated me.
It was that she was jealous. But now when she is ill
she sends for me. But I will not go. No, I will not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Madame, if she is ill? We could manage for
a few days." She was riven with emotion, then the
storm passed. Again we reasoned with her. She must
go. After all, if the old woman was dying....</p>

<p>Madame did not believe in the possible dissolution
of anything so entirely undesirable as her <i lang="fr">belle-mère</i>,
but in the end humanity prevailed. She would go,
but for one night. She would come back early on the
morrow.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, c'est un vrai voyage de sacrifice
that I make." She put on her Sunday clothes, she
took Clémence with her, she came back that night.
Two days later a letter, then a telegram urged her
forth again. We had almost to turn her out of the
house. Was not one voyage of sacrifice enough in a
lifetime of sorrow? And the <i lang="fr">belle-mère</i> would not
die. She, Madame, knew it. Protesting, weeping,
she set out, to come back annoyed, sobered, enraged,
<i lang="fr">bouleversée</i>. <i lang="fr">La belle-mère</i> had died. What else could
one expect from such an ingrate?</p>

<p>And now there was M. Phillipot all alone in the
<i lang="fr">maudite petite maison</i> at Révigny. "Is it that he can
live alone? Pensez donc, Mademoiselle! I, moi qui
vous parle, must give up my good place with my
friends whom I love, to whom I have accustomed
myself, and live in that desert of a Révigny. Is it
that I shall earn good money there? Monsieur?
Il ne gagne rien, mais rien du tout. Pas ça." She
clicked a nail against a front tooth and shot an
expressive finger into the air.</p>

<p>"Then he must come to Bar-le-Duc."</p>

<p>But&mdash;ah, if Mademoiselle only knew what she suffered&mdash;Monsieur
was possessed of goats&mdash;deux chèvres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
that he loved. They had followed him in all his
journeyings; when they were tired the soldiers gave
them rides in the <i lang="fr">camions</i>. To the South they had
gone with him, back to Révigny they had come with
him. To part with them would be death. You do
not know how he loves them. But could one keep
goats in the rue de Véel?</p>

<p>One could certainly not. We looked at Madame.
Physical force might get her to Révigny, no other
power could. Assuredly we who knew her value could
not persuade her. The <i lang="fr">impasse</i> seemed insurmountable.
Then light broke over it, showing the way.
If Monsieur wanted his wife he must abandon his
goats. It was a choice. Let him make it. <i lang="fr">Rien
de plus simple.</i></p>

<p>He chose the goats.</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>If you had ventured into Bar-le-Duc during the
stormy days of 1916, when the waves of the German
ocean beat in vain against the gates of Verdun, you
might have thought that the entire French army was
quartered there. Soldiers were everywhere. The
station-yard was a wilderness of soldiers. In faded
horizon-blue, muddy, inconceivably dirty, with that
air of <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi de fagoté</i> which distinguishes them,
they simply took possession of the town. The <i lang="fr">pâtisseries</i>
were packed&mdash;how they love cakes, <i lang="fr">choux-à-la-crême</i>,
<i lang="fr">brioches</i>, <i lang="fr">madeleines</i>, tarts!&mdash;the Magasins
Réunis was a tin in which all the sardines were blue
and all had been galvanised into life; fruit-shops belched
forth clouds that met, mingled and strove with clouds
that sought to envelop the vacated space; in the
groceries we, who were women and mere civilians at
that, stood as suppliants, "with bated breath and
whispering humbleness," and generally stood in vain.
But for Madame I verily believe we would have starved.
Orderlies from officers' messes away up on the Front
drove, rode or trained down with lists as long as the
mileage they covered, lists that embraced every human
need, from flagons of costly scent to tins of herrings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
or <i lang="fr">pâté-de-foie-gras</i>, or <i lang="fr">Petit Beurre</i>, <i lang="fr">Lulu</i> (the most
insinuating <i lang="fr">Petit Beurre</i> in the world), from pencils
and notepaper to soap, from asparagus and chickens&mdash;twelve
francs each and as large as a fair-sized snipe&mdash;to
dried prunes and hair-oil. We even heard of one
<i lang="fr">popotte</i> which pooled resources and paid twenty-five
francs for a lobster, but perhaps that tale was merely
offered as a tax upon our credulity.</p>

<p>Bar-le-Duc was delirious. Never had it known such
a reaping, never had it heard of such prices. It rose
dizzily to an occasion which would have been sublime
but for the inhumanity of the <i lang="fr">Petite Vitesse</i> which,
lacking true appreciation of the situation, sat down
upon its wheels and ceased to run.</p>

<p>Not that the <i lang="fr">Petite Vitesse</i> was really to blame. It
yearned to indulge in itinerant action, but there was
Verdun, with its gargantuan mouths wide open, all
waiting to be fed, and all clamouring for men, munitions
and <i lang="fr">ravitaillement</i> of every kind. In those days
all roads led to Verdun&mdash;all except one, and that the
Germans were hysterically treading.</p>

<p>However, we wasted no sympathy on the shopkeepers.
Their complete indifference to our needs
drove every melting tenderness from our hearts, or,
to be quite accurate, drove it in another direction&mdash;that
of the poor <i lang="fr">poilu</i> who had no list and no fat
wallet bulging with hundred-franc notes. And I think
he richly deserved all the sympathy we could give him.
Think of the streets as I have described them when
talking of the Marché Couvert, call to mind every
discomfort that weather can impose, add to them,
multiply them exceedingly, and then extend them
beyond the farthest bounds of reason, and you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Bar in the spring of 1916. Cold, wet, snow, sleet,
slush, wind, mud, rain&mdash;interminable rain&mdash;did their
worst with us, and in them all and under most soldiers
lived in the streets. The <i lang="fr">débitants</i> and café-restaurants
were closed during a great part of the day, there
was literally nowhere for them to go. They huddled
like flocks of draggled birds in the station-yard, some
in groups, some in serried mass before the barrier,
some stamping up and down, some sitting on the kerb
or on the low stone parapet from which the railings
spring, and while some, pillowing their heads on their
kits, went exhaustedly to sleep, others crouched with
their backs against the wall. They ate their bread,
opened their tins of <i lang="fr">conserve</i>&mdash;generally potted meat
or sardines&mdash;sliced their cheese with a pocket-knife,
or absorbed needed comfort from bottles which, for
all their original dedication, were rarely destined to
hold water! On the Canal bank they sat or lay in the
snow, on ground holding the seeds of a dozen chilly
diseases in its breast; on the river banks they sprang
up like weeds, on the Boulevard every seat had its
quota, and we have known them to have it for the
night. In all the town there was not a canteen or a
<i lang="fr">foyer</i>, not a hut nor a camp, not a place of amusement
(except a spasmodic cinema), not a room set apart for
their service. They might have been Ishmaels; they
must have been profoundly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Yet no one seemed to realise it. That was the outstanding
explosive feature of the case. Late in the
spring, towards the end of April or in May, buffets
were opened in the station-yard under the ægis of the
Croix Rouge. At one of these ham, sardines, bread,
post cards, tobacco, chocolate, cakes, matches, <i lang="fr">pâté</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
cheese, etc., could be bought; at the other wine, and
possibly beer. The space between was not even roofed
over, and, their small purchases made, the men had to
consume them&mdash;when eatable&mdash;in the open. But of
real solicitude, in the British sense of the word, for
their comfort there was none.</p>

<p>France has shown herself mighty in many ways
during the war, but&mdash;with the utmost diffidence I
suggest it&mdash;not in her care for the men who are waging
it. Our Tommies, with their Y.M.C.A. huts and Church
Army and Salvation huts, with their hot baths, their
sing-songs in every rest-camp, their clouds of ministering
angels, their constellations of adoring satellites
waiting on them hand and foot, are pampered minions
compared with the French soldier. For him there is
neither Y.M.C.A., Church Army nor Salvation Army.
He comes, some three thousand of him, <i lang="fr">en repos</i> to a
tiny village, such as Fains or Saudrupt, Trémont or
Bazincourt, he is crowded into barns, granges, stables
and lofts, he is route-marched by day, he is neglected
by evening. No one worries about him. Amusement,
distraction there is none. No club-room where he
may foregather comfortably, no cheery canteen with
billiards and games, no shops in which if he has money
he can spend it. Blank, cheerless, uncared-for nothingness.
He gets into mischief&mdash;what can you expect?
He goes back to the trenches, and shamed eyes are
averted and hearts weighed with care hide behind
bravado as he goes.</p>

<p>Sometimes you hear, "The men are so weary and so
dispirited they do no harm." They are like dream
people, moving through a world of shadows. Those
who go down into hell do not come back easily to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
things of earth. Sometimes you hear tales that make
you wince. The pity of it! And sometimes you meet
young girls who, tempted beyond their strength, are
paying the price of a sin whose responsibility should
rest on other shoulders.</p>

<p>"My friend the Aumonier at F&mdash;&mdash; does not know
what to do with his men," said the Abbé B. to me one
day. "They are utterly discouraged, he cannot rouse
them; they vow they will not go back to the trenches."
And then he talked of agitators who tried to stir up
disaffection in the ranks, Socialist leaders and the like.
(France has her Bolos to meet even in the humblest
places.) But I could not help thinking that the good
Aumonier's task would have been a lighter one had
plenty of wholesome recreation been provided for his
men in that super-stupid, dull and uninteresting village
of F&mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The migratory soldier going to or from leave, or
changing from one part of the Front to another, might,
as we have seen, wait hours at a junction, cold and
friendless, without where to lay his head. And just
why it was not particularly easy to discover. We
divined a psychological problem, we never really
resolved it.</p>

<p>Does logic, carried to its ultimate conclusion, leave
humanity limping behind it on the road?</p>

<p>Or are the French the victims of their own history?
Did not the Revolution sow the seeds of deep distrust
between aristocracy and bourgeoisie and, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
that, sow an even deeper distrust between bourgeois
and bourgeois? During the Reign of Terror the man
who dined with you to-night all too often betrayed
you on the morrow, neighbour feared neighbour, and
with terrible justification, the home became a fortress
round which ran a moat of silence and reserve, the
family circle became the family horizon, people learned
to live to themselves, to mind their own business and
let the devil or who would mind that of their neighbours.</p>

<p>When England was blossoming in a springtime of
altruism, when great-minded men and women were
learning that the burden of the poor, the sick, the
suffering was their burden to be shouldered and carried
and passed from hand to hand, France was still maimed
and battered by blows from which she has scarcely
yet recovered.</p>

<p>Even to-day French women tell me of the isolation
of their upbringing. "Our father discouraged intercourse
with the families about us."</p>

<p>But that narrow individualism&mdash;or, more properly,
tribalism&mdash;is, I think, dying out, and the present war
bids fair to give it its death-stroke.</p>

<p>Behind the Revolution lay no fine feudal instinct,
no traditions save those of bitter hatred and of resentment
on the one hand, of contempt and oppression
on the other. Not, it will be acknowledged, the best
material out of which to reconstitute a broken world.
And so what might be called collective sympathy was
a feeble plant, struggling pitifully in unfavourable soil.
The great upper class which has made England so
peculiarly what she is scarcely existed in France.
The old aristocracy passed away, the new sprang from
the Napoleonic knapsack; Demos in a gilt frame, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Demos who had much to forget and infinitely more to
learn.</p>

<p>Some philanthropic societies, of course, existed
before the war, but, so far as my knowledge of them
goes, they were run by the State or by its delegates,
the iron hand of officialdom closed down upon them,
they made little if any claim upon the heart of the
people. Perhaps in a nation of such indomitable
independence no more was necessary, but what was
necessary&mdash;if I may dare to say so&mdash;was large-hearted
sympathy and understanding between class
and class&mdash;a common meeting-ground, in fact.</p>

<p>So, at least, I read the problem, and offer you my
solution for what it is worth, uncomfortably aware
that wiser heads than mine may laugh me out of
court and sentence me to eternal derision.</p>

<p>One thing, at least, I do not wish, and that is to bring
in a verdict of general inhumanity and hard-heartedness
against the French nation. A certain imperceptiveness,
lack of intuition, of insight, of the sympathetic imagination&mdash;call
it what you will&mdash;is, perhaps, theirs in a
measure; but, on the other hand, the individual
responds quickly, even emotionally, to an appeal to
his softer side. Only he has not acquired the habit
of exposing his soft side to view and asking the needy
to lean upon it! Nor has he acquired the habit of
going forth to look for people ready to lean. He
accepts the <i lang="la">status quo</i>. But prove to him that it
needs altering, and he is with you heart and hand.
His is an attitude of mind, not of heart. When the
heart is touched the mind becomes its staunchest ally.
The feeding of the refugees done on lavish scale, the
installation of a hostel for the relatives of men dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in hospital are instances of what I mean. For months,
years, poor women, wives and mothers coming to take
their last farewell of those who gave their lives for
France, had no welcome in Bar. All too often they
were unable to find a bed, they wandered the streets
when the hospitals were closed against them, they
slept in the station. Then a <i lang="fr">Médicin-Chef</i>, with a big
heart and reforming mind, suggested that the refugee
dormitories in the market should be converted into a
hostel. No sooner suggested than done. The "Maison
des Parents" sprang into life, a tiny charge was made
for <i lang="fr">le gîte et la table</i>, voluntary helpers served the
meals, organised, catered, kept the accounts. France
only needs to be shown the way. One day she will
seek it out for herself. Every day she is finding new
roads. And this I am sure every one who has worked
as our Society has done will endorse, no appeal has
ever been made in vain to those who, like our friends
in Bar-le-Duc and elsewhere, gave with unstinting
generosity and without self-advertisement.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Think, too, of the hospitals. The call of the wounded
was answered magnificently. Remember that before
the war French hospitals were very much where ours
were in the days of Mrs. Gamp, and before Florence
Nightingale carried her lamp through their dark and
noisome places. It is said that the nursing used to be
done by nuns for the most part, a fact of which the
Government took no cognisance when it drove the
religious orders from the country, and when they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
away it fell into the hands of riff-raff. Women of no
character, imported by students as worthless as themselves,
masqueraded as ministering angels, and it is
safe to assume that they neither ministered nor were
angelic. Gentlewomen, even the <i lang="fr">petit bourgeoisie</i>,
drew their skirts aside from such creatures. The
woman of good birth and education who became a
nurse, not only violated her code by earning her living,
but cut her social cables and drifted out upon an almost
uncharted sea. Only the few who were brave enough
to attempt it trained (if my authorities are reliable)
in England, and no doubt it was owing in large measure
to them that a movement for re-organising the hospitals
was set on foot. But before the project could mature
the church bells, ringing out their call to arms, rang
out a call to French women too, and gathered them
into the nursing profession.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is why the hale, hearty, often dirty,
and by no means always respectful <i lang="fr">poilu</i> has been
neglected. Woman seeing him wounded had no eye
for him whole. Besides, he is rather a bewildering
thing; his gods are not her gods, his standards not her
standards, she is&mdash;dare I whisper it?&mdash;just a little
afraid of him, as we are apt to be of the thing we do
not understand. All her instinct has bidden her
banish him from her orbit, but insensibly, inevitably
he is beginning to move in it, to worm himself in.
Wounded, she has him at her mercy, and when, repaired,
patched and nursed into the semblance of a man again,
he goes back to the trenches surely she can never
think of him in the old way, or look at him from the
old angle? As your true democrat is at heart a complete
snob, the poor <i lang="fr">poilu</i> used to be, and is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
to a large extent still, looked down upon as an inferior
being. Conscription rubbed the hero from him, but
the human being is beginning to emerge.</p>

<p>It is possible that in the hospitals another revolution
is taking place which, if unseen and unguessed at, may
be scarcely less far-reaching in its effects than the old.
It has at least drawn the women outside the charmed
circle of the home, it is bringing them hourly into
contact with a side of life which, but for the war, might
have remained a closed book whose pages they would
always have shrunk from turning. Such close contact
with human agony, endurance and death cannot
leave them unmoved, and though they have not yet
thoroughly mastered the knack of making hospitals
<span class="smcap">HOMES</span>, though many little comforts, graces and
refinements that we think essential are missing, still,
when one remembers the overwhelming ignorance with
which they began and the difficulties they had to
contend with, we must concede that they have done
wonders. For, unlike our V.A.D.s, they did not
step into up-to-date, well-appointed wards with lynx-eyed
sisters, steeped in the best traditions, waiting to
instruct them. Experience was their teacher. They
were amateurs doing professional work, and without
discredit to them we may sympathise with the soldiers
who, transferred from a hospital under British management
to one run by their own compatriots, wept like
children. Which shows that though we may deny him
the quality, the <i lang="fr">poilu</i> appreciates and is grateful for
a good dose of judicious petting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>Yes! The <i lang="fr">poilu</i> deserves our sympathy. He is,
to my mind, one of the most tragic figures of the war.
He is pursued by a fatalism as relentless as it is hopeless,
and whether he is ill or well is subjected to much
unnecessary discomfort. He hates war, he hates the
trenches, he loathes the life of the trenches, he wants
nothing so much in the world as his own hearthstone.
He is often despairing, and convinced of defeat.
("Mademoiselle, never can we drive the Boche from
his trenches, <em>never</em>!") and yet he goes on. There lies
the hero in him&mdash;he goes on. Not one in a hundred
of him has Tommy's cheery optimism, unfailing good-humour,
cheerful grumble and certainty of victory.
And yet he goes on! He sings <i lang="fr">L'Internationale</i>, he
vows in regiments that "on ne marchera plus. C'est
fini"&mdash;but he goes on. He is really rather wonderful,
for he has borne the brunt of heavy fighting for more
than three years, and behind him is no warm barrage
of organised care, of solicitude for his welfare, or public
ministration to shield him from the devils of depression
and despair. His wife, his sister, his mother may
pinch and starve to send him little comforts, but he is
conscious of the pinching, he has not yet got the great
warm heart of a generous nation at his back. Think
of his pay, of his separation allowances (those of the
refugees, one franc twenty-five per day per adult, fifty
centimes per day per child), and then picture him fighting
against heavy odds, standing up to and defying the
might of Germany at Verdun. Isn't he wonderful?</p>

<p>He seems to have no hope of coming through the war
alive. In canteen, in the train, in the kitchens of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
refugees you may hear him say, "At Verdun or on the
Somme, what matter? It will come some time, and
best for those to whom it comes quickly."</p>

<p>"Ceux qui cherchent la mort ne la trouve jamais."
The speaker was a quick, vivid thing, obviously not
of the working classes. He had been <i lang="fr">cité</i> (mentioned)
more than once, and offered his stripes with a view to
a commission several times, but had always refused
them. "For me, I do not mind, but think of the responsibility
... to know that the lives of others hung
upon you, your coolness, quickness, readiness of decision.
<em>Impossible!</em> And it is the sergeants who die.
The mortality among them is higher than in any other
rank. They must expose themselves more, you see....
Oh yes, there are men who are afraid, and there
are men who try to die." It was then he added, "But
those who seek death never find it. The man who
hesitates, who peers over the top of the trench, who
looks this way and that, wondering if the moment is
good, he gets killed; but the man who is not afraid,
the man who wants to die, he rushes straight out, he
rushes straight up to the Boche ... he is never hurt."</p>

<p>And then he and his companion talked of men who
longed to die, who courted death but in vain. Both
expressed a quiet, unemotional conviction that Death
would come to them before long. And both wore the
Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>Old Madame Leblan&mdash;you remember her?&mdash;had a
nephew whom she loved as a son. He and her own
boys had grown up together, and she would talk to
me of Paul by the hour. He saw all the Verdun fighting,
and before that much that was almost as fierce;
he visited her during every leave, he brought her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
her family gifts, napkin-rings, pen-handles, paper-cutters,
finger-rings, all sorts of odds and ends made
in the trenches from shell-cases and the like. He was
always cheery, always sure he would come again.
Paul was like a breeze of sunny wind, he never lost
heart, he never lost hope&mdash;until they gave him his
commission. He refused it over and over again.
Then his Colonel, taxing him with want of patriotism,
forced him to accept it. That week he wrote to
Madame. He told her of his promotion, adding, "In
a fortnight I shall get leave, so I am looking forward
to seeing you all, unless...."</p>

<p>She showed me the letter. She pointed to that
significant "unless...."</p>

<p>"Never have I known Paul to write like that.
Always he said I will come." Her heart was full of
foreboding, and next time I saw her she took out the
letter with shaking hands. Paul was dead.</p>

<p>"He knew," she said, as she wept bitterly; "he
knew when he took his commission."</p>

<p>A reconnaissance from which all his men got back
safely, Paul last of all, crawling on hands and knees
... raises himself to take a necessary observation ...
a sniper ... a swift bullet ... a merciful death ...
and an old heart bleeding from a wound that will never
heal.</p>

<p>"If we see Death in front of us we care no more for
it than we do for that." A Zouave held a glass of
lemonade high above the canteen counter. "For that
is the honour of the regiment. Death?" he shrugged.
"One will die, <i lang="fr">sans doute</i>. At Verdun, on the Somme,
<i lang="fr">n'importe</i>! My <i lang="fr">copain</i> here has been wounded twice.
And I? I had two brothers, they are both in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
cemetery here. Yes, killed at Verdun, M'amzelle;
I was wounded. Some day I suppose that we, <i lang="fr">nous
aussi</i>...." Again he shrugged. "Will you give
me another lemonade?"</p>

<p>He and his companion wore the <i lang="fr">fourragère</i>, the cord
of honour, given to regiments for exceptional gallantry
in the field. They had been at Vaux. And what
marvels of endurance and sheer pluck the Zouaves
exhibited there are matters now of common knowledge.
Personally, I nourish a calm conviction that
but for them and their whirlwind sacrifice Verdun
must have fallen.</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p>Fatalists? Yes. But a thousand other things besides.
It is useless to try and offer you the <i lang="fr">poilu</i> in
tabloid form, he refuses to be reduced to a formula.
The pessimist of to-day is the inconsequent child of
to-morrow. You pity him for his misfortunes, and
straightway he makes you yearn to chastise him for
his impertinence. His manners&mdash;especially in the
street&mdash;like the Artless Bahdar's, "are not always nice."
He can be, and all too often is, frankly indecent; indeed
there are hours when you ask yourself wildly whether
indecency is not just a question of opinion, and whether
standards must shift when frontiers are crossed, and
a new outlook on life be acquired as diligently and as
open-mindedly as one acquires&mdash;or strives to!&mdash;a
Parisian accent.</p>

<p>It is, of course, in the canteen that he can be studied
most easily. There you see him in all his moods, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
there you need all your wits about you if you are not
to be put out of court a hundred times a day. Canteens
are, as we have seen, accidental luxuries on the
French front. They took root in most inhospitable
soil. As happy hunting-grounds for the pacifists and
anti-war agitators they were feared, their value as
restoratives (I speak temperamentally, not gastronomically)
being practically unknown. But once known it
was recognised. The canteen at Bar-le-Duc, for
instance, has been the means of opening up at least
two others, though the opinion of one General, forcibly
expressed when it was in process of installation, filled
its promoters with darkest gloom.</p>

<p>"There will not be an unsmashed bowl, cup or plate
in a week. The men will destroy everything." And
therein proved himself a false prophet, for the men
destroyed nothing&mdash;except our faith in that General's
knowledge of them!</p>

<p>Once, indeed, we did see them in unbridled mood,
and many and deep were the complications that followed
it. It was New Year's Eve, and as I crossed the station
yard I could hear wild revelry ascending to the night.
(Perhaps at this point it would be as well to say that
the canteen was not run by or connected in any way
with our Society, and that I and two members of the
<i lang="fr">coterie</i> worked there as supernumeraries in the evenings
when other work was done. The fourth and by no
means last member was one of the fairy godmothers
whose magic wand had waved it into being.) Going in,
I found it as usual in a fog of smoke, and thronged with
men. Now precisely what befell it would take too
long to relate, but I admit you to some esoteric knowledge.
The evening, for me, began with songs sung in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
chorus, passed swiftly to solos which blistered the air,
and which would have been promptly silenced had not
Authority warned us "to leave the men alone, they are
in dangerous mood to-night." (A warning with which
one helper, at least, had no sympathy.) It may safely
be assumed that there was much in those songs which
we did not understand, but, judging by what we did,
ignorance was more than bliss, it was the topmost
pinnacle of discretion.</p>

<p>The soloist hoarse (he should have had a megaphone,
so terrific was the din), his place was taken by a creature
so picturesque that all my hearts went out to him at
once. (It is as well to take a few hundred with you
when you go to France, they have such a trick of mislaying
themselves.) He was tall and slender, finely
made, splendidly poised, well-knit, a graceful thing
with finished gestures, and he wore a red fez, wide
mustard-coloured trousers and a Zouave coat. He
was singularly handsome with chiselled features and
eyes of that deep soft brown that one associates with
the South. Furthermore, he possessed no mean gift
of oratory.</p>

<p>He stood on the bench that did duty as a platform.
Jan Van Steen might have painted the canteen then,
or would he have vulgarised it? In spite of everything,
in some indefinable way it was not vulgar, and yet
we instinctively felt that it ought to have been. What
saved it? Ah, that I cannot tell. Perhaps the dim
light, or the faint blueish haze of tobacco smoke, the
stacked arms, trench-helmets hanging on the walls.
Or else that wonderful horizon-blue, a colour that is
capable of every artistic <i lang="fr">nuance</i>, that lures the imagination,
that offers a hundred beauties to the eye, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
can resolve itself as exquisitely against the dark boarding
of a canteen as against the first delicate green of
spring, or against autumn woods a riot of colour.</p>

<p>Now the speech of that graceless creature, swaying
lightly above the crowd, was everything that a canteen
or war-time speech ought not to be. It began with
abuse of capitalists&mdash;well, they deserved it, perhaps.
It taxed them with all responsibility for the war, it
yearned passionately to see them in the trenches.
There, at least, we were in accord. We know a few....
But when it went on to say that the masses who fought
were fools, that they should "down tools," that the
German is too rich, too powerful, too well-organised,
too supreme a militarist ever to be defeated....
Then British pride arose in arms.... Just what
might have happened I cannot say, for French pride
arose too, and as it rose the orator descended, and holy
calm fell for a moment upon the raging tumult.</p>

<p>It was indeed a hectic evening, and I, for one, was
hoarse for two days after it. Even "Monsieur désire?"
or "Ça fait trente-trois sous, Monsieur," was an exercise
requiring vocal cords of steel or of wire in such a
hubbub, and mine, alas! are of neither.</p>

<p>But the descent of the orator was not the end.
Somehow, no matter how, it came to certain ears that
the canteen that night had been the scene of an "orgy,"
the reputation of France was at stake, and so it befell
that one afternoon when the thermometer sympathetically
registered twenty-two degrees of frost, Colonel X.
interviewed those of us who had assisted at the revels,
separately one by one, in the little office behind the
canteen. He wanted, it seems, to find out exactly
what had happened. Well, he found out!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Put to the question, "Colonel X.," quoth I, not
knowing the enormity I was committing, "the men
had drunk a little too much."</p>

<p>"But, Mademoiselle," his dignity was admirable,
reproof was in every line of his exquisitely-fitting
uniform, "soldiers of France are never drunk."</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;this very sweetly&mdash;"can you tell me
where they get the wine?"</p>

<p>And he told me! He ought to have shot me, of
course, and no doubt I should richly have deserved it.
But inadvertently I had touched upon one of his pet
grievances. The military authorities can close the
<i lang="fr">débitants</i> and restaurants, but they cannot close the
<i lang="fr">épiceries</i>.</p>

<p>"Every grocer in France," he cried, "can get a
license to sell wine. He sends a small boy&mdash;<i lang="fr">un vrai
gosse</i>&mdash;to the Bureau, he stamps a certificate, he pays
a few francs, and that is all. A soldier can fill his bottle
at any grocer's in the town. Why," he went on, the
original cause of our interview forgotten and the delinquent
turned confidante, "not long ago I entrained a
regiment here sober, Mademoiselle, I assure you sober,
but when they arrived at R&mdash;&mdash; they were drunk.
And the General was furious. 'What do you mean by
sending me drunken soldiers?' he thundered. They
had filled their bottles, they were thirsty in the
train...."</p>

<p>But officially, you understand, soldiers of France are
never drunk. Actually they seldom are. Coming
home after six months in Bar, I saw more soldiers under
the influence of drink in a week (it included a journey
to Ireland in a train full of ultra-cheerful souls) than
in all my time in France. That men who were far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
sober came occasionally to the canteen cannot be
denied, there are rapscallions in every army, but the
percentage was small, and with twenty-two degrees of
frost gnawing his vitals there is excuse for the man
who solaces himself with wine.</p>


<p class="center">V</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the French mind that
Colonel X. could not understand why we did not call
the station guard and turn the rioters into the street.
To wander about in that bitter wind, to get perhaps
into all sorts of trouble! Better a rowdy canteen a
hundred times over.</p>

<p>We were frank enough&mdash;at least I know I was&mdash;on
that aspect of the episode, and, all honour to him, he
conceded a point though he failed to understand its
necessity. But now, as at so many pulsating moments
of my career, the ill-luck that dogs me seized me in the
person of the Canteen-Chief and removed me from the
room. She, poor ignorant dear, thought I was being
indiscreet, whereas I was merely being receptive. I
am sure I owe that Canteen-Chief a grudge, and I
<span class="smcap">HOPE</span> the Colonel thinks he does, but on that point his
discretion has been perfect.</p>

<p>Only in the very direst extremity would we have
called in the station guard. We knew the deep-seated
animosity with which the soldier views the gendarme.
I may be wrong, but my firm impression is that he
hates him even more than, or quite as much, as he hates
the Boche. I suppose because he does not fight. There
must be something intensely irritating to a war-scarred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
soldier in the sight of a strapping, well-fed, comfortable
policeman. You know the story of the wounded
Tommy making his way back from the lines and being
accosted by a red-cap?</p>

<p>"'Some' fight, eh?" he inquired blandly.</p>

<p>"Some don't," retorted Tommy, and that sums the
situation up more neatly than a volume of explanation.</p>

<p>Once, after the Walpurgis Night, a man chose to be
noisy and slightly offensive in the canteen. It was a
thing that rarely happened, and could always be dealt
with, but, smarting possibly under a reprimand, the
guard rushed in, seized a quiet, inoffensive, rather
elderly man who was meekly drinking his coffee, and
in spite of remonstrances and protestations in which
the canteen-workers joined, dragged him off, cutting
his throat rather badly with a bayonet in the scuffle.
A little incident which in no way inclined us to lean for
support, moral or otherwise, upon the guardians of
military law. But we gave them their coffee or
chocolate piping hot just the same.</p>

<p>And there were weeks when hot drinks were more
acceptable than would have been promise of salvation.</p>

<p>"Bien chaud" ("Very hot") they would cry, coming
in with icicles on their moustaches and snow thick on
their shoulders. Once an officer asked for coffee.</p>

<p>"Very hot, please."</p>

<p>"It is boiling, Monsieur." He gulped it down.</p>

<p>"It is the first hot food I have tasted for fourteen
days."</p>

<p>"From Vaux?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, front line trenches. Everything frozen, the
wine in the wine-casks solid. Yes, another bowl,
please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Once another officer came in accompanied by an
older man whom we thought must be his father. He
begged for water.</p>

<p>"It comes straight from the main tap, it is neither
filtered nor boiled," we told him.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr">N'importe.</i>" No, he would not have tea nor coffee.
Water, cold water. He had a raging, a devouring
thirst. A glass was filled and given him.</p>

<p>"Suppose Monsieur gets typhoid?"</p>

<p>"He has it now," the elderly man replied. "His
temperature is high, that is why he has so great thirst."
The patient drank another glass. Then they both went
away. We often wondered whether he recovered.</p>

<p>Once, at least, our hearts went out to another sick
man. He leaned against the counter with pallid face,
over which the sweat of physical weakness was breaking.
Questioned, he told us he had just been discharged
from hospital, he was going back to the trenches, to
Verdun, in the morning. He looked as if he ought to
have been in his bed. I wonder if any society exists
in France with the object of helping such men? We
never heard of one (which by no means proves that it
does not exist), but oh, how useful it might have been
in Bar! One morning, for instance, a man tottered
into the canteen, ordered a cup of coffee, drank, laid
his head down on the table and fell into a stupefied
doze. So long did he remain the canteeners became
anxious. Presently he stirred, and told them that he
had come there straight from a hospital, that he was
going home on leave, that his home was far&mdash;perhaps
two days' journey&mdash;away, and he had not a sou in his
pocket. He was by no means an isolated case. As
a packet of food was being made up for him, a soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
obviously a stranger to the sick man, ordered <i lang="fr">deux
œufs sur-le-plat</i>."</p>

<p>"They are not for myself," he said, "but for the
pal here." A little act of good comradeship that was
by no means the only one of its kind.</p>

<p>The moment which always thrilled was that in which
a regimental Rothschild treated his companions to
the best of our store. How eagerly and exhaustively
the list of <i lang="fr">boissons</i> was studied!</p>

<p>"Un café? C'est combien? Deux sous? ce n'est
pas cher ça." Then to a friend, "Qu'est-ce-que-tu-prends?"</p>

<p>"Moi? je veux bien un café."</p>

<p>"No, non, un chocolat. C'est très bon le chocolat."
The coffee lover wavers.</p>

<p>"Soit. Un chocolat alors." Then some one else
cannot make up his mind. A bearded man pouring
<i lang="fr">bouillon</i> down his throat recommends that. It is excellent.
The merits of soup are discussed. Then back
they go to coffee again, and all the time as seriously
as if the issue of the war depended upon their deliberations.
At length, however, a decision is made&mdash;not
without much pleading for <i lang="fr">gniolle</i> (rum) on the part of
Rothschild. "A drop? Just a tiny drop, Mad'm'zelle.
Eh, there is none? <i lang="fr">Mais comment ça?</i> How
can one drink a <i lang="fr">jus</i> (coffee) without <i lang="fr">gniolle</i>? Mad'm'zelle
is not kind." He would wheedle a bird from the
bushes, but happily for our strength of mind there is no
drink stronger than <i lang="fr">jus</i> in the canteen, a fact he finds
it exceedingly difficult to believe. We know that when
at last he accepts defeat he is convinced that fat bottles
lie hidden under the counter to be brought forth for
one whose powers of persuasion are greater than his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
He loads his bowls on a tray, carries them by some
occult means unbroken through the throng, and has
his reward when the never-failing ceremony of clinking
bowls or glasses with <i lang="fr">Bonne chance!</i> or <i lang="fr">Bonne Santé!</i>
or <i lang="fr">À vous</i>, prefaces the feast.</p>

<p>A pretty rite that of the French. Never did two
comrades drink together in the canteen without doing
it reverence. Never did I, visiting a refugee, swallow,
for my sins, <i lang="fr">vin ordinaire rouge</i> in which a lump of
sugar had been dissolved without first clinking glasses
with my hosts and murmuring a "Good health," or
"Good luck," and feeling strangely and newly in
sympathy with them as I did so. The little rite
invested commonplace hospitality with grace and
spiritual meaning.</p>


<p class="center">VI</p>

<p>However, you must not think that the canteen kept
us in a state of soppy sentiment, or even of perfervid
sympathy. Sanity was the mood that suited it best.
Presence of mind the quality that made for success.
A sense of humour the saving grace that made both the
former possible. When a thin, dark individual leans
upon the counter for half an hour or more, silent,
ruminative, pondering&mdash;it is a quiet night, no rush&mdash;gather
your forces together. His eyes follow you
wherever you go, you see revelations hovering on his
lips. You become absorbed in ham or sausage (horse-sausage
is incredibly revolting), but your absorption
cannot last. Even sausages fail to charm, and then the
dark one sees his opportunity. He leans towards you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
... His faith in himself must be immense.... Does he
really think that a journey to Paris at 2 a.m. in an
omnibus train and a snowstorm can tempt you? If
we had consoled all the lonely <i lang="fr">poilus</i> who offered us&mdash;temporarily&mdash;their
hands, their hearts and their five
sous a day we should now be confirmed bigamists.</p>

<p>Or it may be that you are busy and contemplation
of sausage unnecessary. Then he sets up a maddening
<i lang="fr">Dîtes, dîtes, dîtes, Mad'm'zelle</i>, that drives you to
distraction. To silence him is impossible. Indifference
leaves him unmoved. He is like a clock in a
nightmare that goes on striking <span class="smcap">ONE</span>!</p>

<p>That he has an eye for beauty goes without saying.
"Voilà, une jolie petite brune! Vas-y." So two vagabonds
catching sight of a decorative canteener, and
off they go to discuss the price of ham, for only by such
prosaic means can Sentiment leap over the counter.
He addresses you by any and every name that comes
into his head. "La mère," "la patronne" (these before
he grasped the fact that the canteen was an
<i lang="fr">œuvre</i> and not a commercial enterprise), "la petite,"
"la belle," "la belle Marguerite," "la Frisée," "la
Dame aux Lunettes," "la petite Rose," and many
others I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Indeed, the French aptitude for nicknames based on
physical attributes was constantly thrust on us. The
refugees, finding our own names uncomfortable upon
the tongue, fell back on descriptive nomenclature.
"La Blonde," "la Blanche," for the fair-haired. "La
Grande," "la Belle," "la belle Dame au Lunettes,"
"la petite bleue," "la Directrice," "la grande dame
maigre." And once when a bill was in dispute in a
shop the proprietress exclaimed, "Is it that you wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to know who bought the goods? It was la petite qui
court toujours et qui est toujours si pressée" (the
little lady who always runs and is always in such a
hurry). As a verbal snapshot it has never been
equalled. It would have carried conviction in any
court in the country.</p>

<p>But most of all the heart of the soldier rejoices when
he can call you his <i lang="fr">marraine</i> (godmother). That we,
mere English, pursued by ardent souls, should sometimes
be compelled to send out S.O.S. messages to our
comrades; that, feeling the mantle of our dignity slipping
perilously from our shoulders, we should cast aside
our remote isolation and engage the worker in the
"next department" in animated conversation, was
only to be expected. But our hearts rejoiced and the
imps in us danced ecstatically when Madame D. was
discovered one day hiding in the office. She, splendid
ally that she always was, volunteered to sit at the receipt
of custom on certain afternoons each week, and, clad
in her impenetrable panoply, at once suavely polite,
gracious but infinitely aloof, to sell <i lang="fr">tickés</i> with subdued
but inextinguishable enjoyment. But a lonely <i lang="fr">poilu</i>
strayed by who badly needed a <i lang="fr">marraine</i>, and so
persistent was he in his demands, so irresistible in his
pleadings, so embarrassing in his attentions, Madame,
the panoply melting and dignity snatched by the winds,
fled to the office, from whence no persuasions could
lure her till the lonely one had gone his unsatisfied way.</p>

<p>It is the man from the <i lang="fr">pays envahi</i> who, most of all,
needs a <i lang="fr">marraine</i>, e. g. a sympathetic, sensible woman
who will write to him, send him little gifts and take
an interest in his welfare. Because all too often he
stands friendless and alone. His relatives, his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
having remained in their homes, between him and them
lies silence more awful than death. He is a prey to
torturing fears, he endures much agony of mind, dark
forebodings hang about him like a miasma poisoning
all his days. No news! And his loved ones, in the
hands of a merciless foe, may be in the very village
the French or the British are shelling so heavily!
From his place in the trenches he may see the tall
chimneys, the church spire in the distance. He has
been gazing yearningly at them for two years, has seen
landmarks crumble and steeples totter as the guns
searched out first one, then another.... A <i lang="fr">marraine</i>
may well save the reason of such men as these. She
can assuredly rob life of much of its bitterness, and
inspire it with hope and courage to endure.</p>

<p>One of these men who came from Stenay told us of
his misery. He had done well in the army, had been
promoted, might have been commissioned, but his
loneliness, the vultures of conjecture that tugged at
his heart, his longing and his grief overwhelmed him
one night, and seeking distraction in unwise ways he
fell into dire trouble, and was reduced to the ranks....</p>

<p>And yet, though I write of these poor derelicts, it is
the gay and gallant who holds my imagination. The
thing of the "glad eye," and the swagger, the jest,
"Going <i lang="fr">en permission</i>, Mad'm'zelle," the happiest
thing in France! It is he, the irrepressible, who carries
gaiety through the streets as he rolls by in his <i lang="fr">camions</i>;
he sings, he plays discordant instruments, he buys
<i lang="fr">couronnes</i> of bread, he shouts to the women. "Ah,
la belle fille!" "Mad'm'zelle, on aura un rendez-vous
là-bas." Sometimes he is more explicit:&mdash;intermittent
deafness is an infirmity of psychological value in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
War Zone! And he thoroughly enjoys the canteen.
He likes "ploom-cak," he likes being waited on by <i lang="fr">Les
Anglaises</i>, he likes the small refinements (though now
and then he "borrows" the forks), he appreciates
generosity, he is by no means ungrateful (see him
pushing a few coppers across the counter with a shamefaced
"C'est pour l'œuvre"), and at his worst, least
controlled, most objectionable, he can be shamed into
silence or an apology by a few firm or tactful words.</p>

<p>A bewildering thing! If I wrote of him for ever I
should not be able to explain him.</p>

<p>And so the tale is written, and the story told in
strange halting numbers that can but catch here and
there at the great melody of the human symphony.</p>

<p>Just for one moment one may lay one's finger on
the pulse of a great nation, feel its heart beat, feel the
quivering, throbbing life that flows through its veins,
but more than that who dare hope to gain? Not in
one phase, nor in one era, not in one great crisis nor
even in a myriad does the heart of a people express
itself fully. From birth to death, from its first feeble
primitive struggles as it emerges from the Womb of
Time to its last death-throe as it sinks back again
into the Nothingness from which it came, it gathers
to itself new forces, new aspirations, new voices, new
gods, new altars, new preachers, new goals, new
Heavens, new Hells, new readings of the Riddle that
only Eternity will solve. It is in perpetual solution,
and the composite atoms that compose it are in a state
of unending change and transmutation; it dies but
to live again in other forms, is silent only to express
itself through new and&mdash;may we not hope it?&mdash;more
finely-tuned instruments.</p>

<p>Summarising it to-day you may say of your summary,
This is Truth. But to-morrow it is already
falsehood, for the Nation, bound upon the Wheel of
Evolution, has passed on, leaving you bewildered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the way. And since the war has thrown the nations
of the world into the crucible, until they come forth
again, and not till then, may we say, with finality,
"This is gold, or that alloy."</p>

<p>France is being subjected to a severe test; her
burden is almost more than she can bear, but as she
shoulders it we see the gold shining, we believe that
the dross is falling away. No defeat in the field&mdash;if
such an end were possible&mdash;can rob her of her glory,
just as no victory could save Germany from shame.
"What shall it profit a Nation if it gain the whole
world, and lose its own soul?" The soul of Germany
is withered and dead. She has sacrificed it on the
Altar of Militarism, and has set up the galvanic battery
of a relentless despotism and crude materialism in its
place.</p>

<p>But the Soul of France lives on, strengthened and
purified, the Soul of a Nation that seeks the Light and
surely one day shall find it.</p>

Prisoner of Zenda," "Rupert of Hentzau," etc., etc. Crown 8vo,
cloth, 5s. net.</p>

<div class="small">
<p>In this novel, Anthony Hope, after a long interval, returns again to similar
scenes that formed the background of his famous novel "The Prisoner of
Zenda."</p>

<p>Captain Dieppe, adventurer, servant of fortune, and, if not a fugitive, still
a man to whom recognition would be inconvenient and perhaps dangerous,
with only fifty francs in his pocket and a wardrobe in a knapsack might be
seen marching up a long steep hill on a stormy evening. Later he finds
himself before a castle bordering on a river and his curiosity is roused by
finding only one half of the house lighted up. He meets the Count of
Fieramondi, hears from him a strange story, and of course takes an active
interest in his affairs.</p>

<p>The story, which has a powerful love interest running through it, tells of his
many adventures.</p>

Country," "Marcia in Germany," etc. Cloth, 6s. net.</p>

<div class="small">
<p>This delightful novel can be thoroughly recommended. It gives a very
true impression of a bit of English life in and about a provincial town in
War time. The story concerns three daughters of a Colonel, of whom the
eldest is the central figure. These and the other characters who are interwoven
into the story are absolutely natural, convincing and typical, and
will be found most interesting company.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>Rotorua Rex</b>: By <span class="smcap">J. Allen Dunn</span>. Cloth, and with an
attractive coloured wrapper, 6s. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>Everybody is on the look-out for a good strong story of love and adventure.
Here is an exceptionally fine one, on the South Seas, which all lovers of
Stevenson's and Stacpoole's novels will thoroughly enjoy. Each page grips
the attention of the reader, and few will put the book down till the last page
is reached.</p>

<hr class="full" /></div>

<p class="hang"><b>Simpson of Snell's</b>: By <span class="smcap">William Hewlett</span>, Author of "The
Child at the Window," "Introducing William Allison," "The
Plot Maker," etc. Cloth, with an attractive coloured wrapper, 6s. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>This is a story, or rather study, of a young clerk, the type of clerk that
the modern commercial machine turns out by the hundred thousand as a
by-product of our civilization. Simpson, invoicing clerk at Snell's, the
celebrated patent-food people, had always seen life through the medium
of thirty shillings a week, and the only oasis in his dreary desert of existence
was his annual fortnight at Margate, where flannels, cheap excitements and
"girls" abounded.</p>

<p>Why did not Mr. William Hewlett leave Simpson in this humble obscurity?
Well, because Destiny had a great and moving part for him in the comedy of
life! I don't think Simpson ever realized it was a "part" he was playing.
It was certainly not the part he planned for himself, and throughout the
period in which, at Mr. Hewlett's bidding he appears as a public character,
he is seen almost invariably doing the thing he dislikes.</p>

<p>Simpson would have pursued the customary course of clerking and philandering
to the end of his days, had it not been for an enterprising hosier, an
unenterprising actor and the egregious Ottley&mdash;the public-school "Spark"
dropped into Snell's like a meteor from the skies. The hosier and the actor
introduced poor Simpson to "temperament," and temperament is a restive
horse in a needy clerk's stable. But Ottley introduced him to Winnie.
Winnie was there before, of course, a typist in his own office. But it was not
until Ottley wove his evil web for Nancy that Winnie wove her innocent
spell for Simpson. And because Winnie held Simpson securely and loved
her friend's honour better than her own happiness, he rose to the full height
of manhood, and to make the supreme sacrifice which turned him, an avowed
enemy of heroics, into the greatest and most unexpected of heroes.</p>

<p>The story has a strong love-interest running through it with a most
dramatic ending. It cannot fail to increase Mr. William Hewlett's popularity,
and the publishers wish to draw special attention to it.</p>

Lady Detective who unravels a great Jewel Mystery. Cloth, and
with an attractive coloured wrapper, 6s. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>Millicent Newberry, a small, inconspicuous woman in grey, is a clever
lady detective.</p>

<p>She keeps green wool by her and knits a kind of pattern of her case into
the article she is making at the time. When the story opens, she is asked
to employ her wits to the loss of the Mason Emeralds. The Green Jacket is
the bit of knitting she has in hand. Her condition of undertaking a case is
permission to deal privately with the criminal as she thinks best&mdash;reforming
treatment rather than legal punishment&mdash;and she makes it work.</p>

<p>This detective story can be thoroughly recommended. The Author combines
an exciting story with the charm of real literary art; the mystery is so
impenetrable as to baffle the cleverest readers until the very sentence in which
the secret is revealed.</p>

Rebellion. Cloth, and with an attractive coloured wrapper, 6s. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>Here is a first novel which, we believe, will bring to the Author immediate
popularity. It is an attractive story of the Stuart Rebellion of the
'45, full of love and adventure and with a good ending. The hero, young
Chisholm, of English birth, joins Prince Charlie and the Stuart cause. How
he meets and loves Sheila, the young girl chieftain of the Mac Ross Clan,
and their many perils and adventures with rival claimants and traitors,
together with happenings of many historical persons and incidents appearing
throughout the story, make "Claymore" one of the best and arresting
historical novels published for many a year.</p>

with an attractive coloured wrapper, 3s. 6d. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>Mr. Le Queux's famous detective novels need no introduction to readers;
they sell by the tens of thousands. The "Cabinet Minister" is a new novel
with a weird and fascinating plot which holds the reader from the first page
to the last. His Majesty's Cabinet Minister, Mr. George Chesham, has disappeared
in very mysterious circumstances, and in his place is a dead stranger,
who let himself into the house with Mr. Chesham's own latch-key. This is the
problem set for the public and readers to unravel. The story is full of highly
exciting incidents of love and adventure, with a strong detective interest&mdash;the
Covers unravelling the mystery&mdash;in the true Le Queux style.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>The Secret Monitor</b>: By <span class="smcap">Guy Thorne</span>. Author of "The Secret

<div class="small">
<p>A remarkable, thrilling and swiftly-moving story of love, adventure and
mystery woven round about half a dozen characters on the Atlantic coast of
Ireland, Liverpool and elsewhere, in connection with the invention of a new
material made from papier mâché (destined to take the place of steel), and
the building of a wonderful new ship from it. Finally, when launched,
"The Secret Monitor" goes on a mission to destroy a German base, and
a succession of breathless adventures follow. This novel ought to considerably
increase the popularity which has been gradually and consistently
growing for Mr. Guy Thorne's mystery novels. No one, after picking up the
book, will want to put it down until the last page is read.</p>

D.D., Canon of Ely. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d. net (postage 3d.).</p>
<div class="small">
<p>The purpose of these excellent sermons is to bring out the value of the
Epistle of St. James in this present time of strain and difficulty. The writer
believes that St. James wrote in circumstances very similar to our own, and
that his teaching is in many instances exactly that which we require. The
sermons are arranged as a course for Lent and Easter, and contain an
exposition of almost every important passage in the Epistle.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>Lenten Teaching in War Time</b>: By the Rev. <span class="smcap">J. H.
Williams</span>, M.A., Author of "Christmas Peace in War Time,"
"Lenten Thoughts in War Time," etc. Crown 8vo. Cloth, 2s. 6d. net.</p>
<div class="small">
<p>These Addresses are eminently practicable. The effects of the War on
the earthly life are closely followed as illustrations of what takes place in the
Spiritual life. Thus, a comparison is drawn between the present enforced
abstinence occasioned by the War and the Church's command to self-denial
during Lent.</p>

<p>They contain many new thoughts, and the subjects dealt with are treated
in new ways. The subjects chosen for Ash Wednesday, the Sundays in Lent,
Good Friday, Easter Eve and Easter Day, are singularly appropriate, viz.:
"Self-Denial," "Conflict," "Help," "Perseverance," "Relief," "Sacrifice."
"Triumph," "Suffering," "The Body of Jesus," "The Conqueror of the
Grave."</p>
<p>Many of the thoughts are illustrated by similes and anecdotes very touching
and appropriate.</p>

<p>It will be difficult to find Lenten Sermons better suited to country congregations
and to others who appreciate plain teaching.</p>

<p>They are likely to prove the more palatable because some reference to the
War is contained in each (postage 2d.).</p>

By <span class="smcap">Hilda Parham</span>. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. net (postage 3d.).</p>
<div class="small">
<p>A work of beauty, ability and intense earnestness. It is full of beautiful
thoughts, and presents a new way of regarding the Season of Lent. There
are no "drybones" in this work. It is therefore interesting as well as
devotional. It supplies a very excellent and necessary meditation on our
want of any real sense of sin. It also presents excellent teaching in the
sinfulness of little sins.</p>

<p>The book contains brief meditations for Lent upon the Five Sorrowful
Mysteries, impressing the Father's love as shown forth in the life of Christ
and tracing the Fruit of the Holy Spirit in the Passion.</p>

<p>There is one main thought throughout each week (with illustrative poem).
In simple devotional tone <i>each day</i> strikes its clear note of Catholic teaching.
The Publishers wish to draw very special attention to this beautiful book.</p>

<p>A Series of Addresses suitable for "A Retreat," "A Quiet Day," or for
private reading with many entirely new thoughts and the expressions of
thought. The book is written with marked ability and can be thoroughly
recommended.</p>

<p>It contains eight chapters suggesting thought, and stimulating the praise
and worship of God. In these days of emotion and spiritual disquiet it is
a wholesome thing to be drawn to think about the relation of body and
spirit in the harmony of the life of grace. The mistaken distinctions of
natural and spiritual are here put away, and man is shown in his common
life as the Child of God, intent upon doing his Father's business.</p>

<p><b>The Church Quarterly</b> says: "These are really Sermons suited <i>for</i>
Children, alike in mode of thought, simplicity of language, and lessons conveyed,
and they are very beautiful. No mere critical description can do
justice to the charm with which spiritual and moral lessons are made to
flow (not merely are drawn) out of natural facts or objects. Stories, too, are
made use of with admirable taste, and the lessons taught are, without exception,
sound and admirable. We cannot doubt that the volume will be, and
will remain, a standard favourite."</p>
